            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Moreouer he apprehendeth a mutuall and long AFFEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION euen from the yonge yeares of the one betwixt MOTHER and DAVGHTER, as alſo the vnited hearts of WIFE and DAVGHTER, both embracing the moſt Noble Earle of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of famous Memorie, the one with the LOVE of a WIFE towards her HVSBAND, the other with the AFFECTION of a DAVGHTER to her deare FATHER: Whoſe LOVE to requite, he with his owne hands ſtiled your GRACE, his DEARE DAVGHTER; and your HONOVR, his DEARE WIFE of whome he further gaue his moſt ample Teſtimonie and in theſe words: I WILL SAYE THAT THERE WAS NEVER MAN HAD A MORE LOVING AND VERTVOVS WIFE THEN SHE HATH BEENE TO MEE. And as your LOVE hath beene GREAT to this moſt honourable Earle, who was Diſcreet in his words, Prudent and iuſt in all his Actions, Charitable to the Poore, Affable to all, Faithfull to his Countrie, Gratious to his Soueraigne, Conſtant in his Faith and Religion, moſt beloued and honoured of all; and then whome noe Noble man of England was more affected, or more Generally honoured in his life, or more Bewayled and lamented after his death; So your VERTVES doe shine in this world with a moſt reſplendent LIGHT, and are the DIAMONDS and PEARLES which adorne the RING of your Auncient NOBILITIE. And theſe his, and your Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call VERTVES, being grounded on the ROCK of a true FAITH, as they haue made the Earle, ſo they will make you CONSTANT SVPPORTERS of holy CATHOLIKE RELIGION; Theſe being fixed to the ANCHOR of HOPE, as they haue guided him, ſo will they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you to the quiet HAVEN of eternall FELICITIE. Yea it is verily to be hoped that he by theſe VERTVES, is there alreadie arriued, whilſt the one of you like a PHAROS, and the other like the CYNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVRE with the FLAMES of CHARITIE, doe giue LIGHT vnto others, in this time of DARKNES.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (MOST VERTVOVS LADIES) to whome after the moſt Noble Earle (to whome this WORKE was firſt deſigned, and for whome before his death it was ſett on the PRESSE) can I more worthilie dedicate theſe, CENTVRIES OF OVR ECCLESIASTICALL HISTORIE, then to theſe, in whome the Noble Earle ſtill in renowme SVRVIVES?

The holy Prophets, Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, and other holy Writers of holy Scriptures, beholding and moſt certainely knowing of God, by diuine reuelation what they committed to writing, are moſt properly and truely the beſt Hiſtorians, and their Writings moſt properly beſt and trueſt Hiſtories: and next to them the true Narration or Hiſtory of their Traditions, and holy doctrine and teachings which were moſt true and certaine, taken from the moſt auncient and approued Antiquities, Antiquaries and Regiſters ef thoſe things where they were performed, And in times and places of Controuerſies, Contentions &amp; Queſtions about Religion, noe Hiſtory, Narration, or Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Hiſtory ſignifieth of Eccleſiaſticall affaires, can be more requiſite, or neceſſary to knowe, and truely finde true Religion, to receaue and profeſſe it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing all true Chriſtians confeſſe, and agree, that this holy Lawe, Religion, Religation, and Dutie was truely taught by Chriſt, and his holy Apoſtles, and Diſciples, and, as in many other Kingdomes, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſo in this Noble Kingdome of greate Britaine, by his greateſt Apoſtles, and Diſciples, S.

            <p>And this which I haue taken in hand, eſpecially the firſt 600. yeares, are the moſt difficulte Worke Britaine had to be performed in this kynde, moſt or many of the Antiquities and Monuments of thoſe times by many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of enemies to thoſe holy dayes, parſons, and proceedings, deſtroyed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, concealed, ſuppreſſed, defaced, or abuſed, and thoſe that from many difficulties, and dangers be ſtill preſerued, are not without greate fauour, labour, diligence and coſt to poore Students, eſpecially Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks to be obtained. Yet I a poore Catholike Student in holy learning from my young yeares, vnto my now old Age, may boldly confeſſe, which this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory itſelfe will proue, that I haue ſeene, &amp; diligently peruſed the moſt &amp; beſt Monuments, and Antiquities extant, or their true Copies, which I could learne of, know and procure, requiſite and vſefull for ſuch a Worke, and therefore at the entreaty and deſire of diuers my learned friends, hauing better opinion of my ſtudies and reading, then I dare affirme of my ſelfe, haue taken this greate charge in hand, and wholly performed and ended it, written in our English tongue, becauſe principally of England, and to English men.</p>

Theſe things and others like vnto theſe, were confirmed with often relations, and in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner manifeſt meſſages of men coming out of thoſe parts.

                  <p n="4">4.

And this onely by that happy meanes, in that reſpect, that they then dwelled at Rome, where they obtained moſt certaine and ſpeedy intelligence of theſe things.

For neither at that time, nor all the life of S.

And ſo whether we will ſay, that this holy Bishop
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7552:33"/> of Britaine, went from hence to S. Peter in the Eaſterne Contries, or S. Peter was then here in theſe partes, when he conſecrated him Bishop or Preiſt, no man can be ſo vnaduiſed to thinke, that he was the onely Bishop, Preiſt, and Chriſtian alſo of this Nation then: This cannot enter in any reaſonable iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If we ſay that S. Manſuetus went out of this Nation to S. Peter in the Eaſterne Contries, (which Proteſtants will rather agree vnto) this maketh as much for the honour of that Apoſtle, and the loue and reuerence of our firſt Chriſtians vnto him, to drawe them by ſuch forcible bands thereof, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo long &amp; dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous a iorney to be inſtructed by that holy Apoſtle. And this holy Bishop being Aſſociate to S.

And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of Tertullian, liuing and dying before this Conuerſion of Scotland,

For Tertullian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and writing in Afrike, could not poſſibly take notice of things done here in an Iland ſo farre of, preſently after they were firſt effected: and by no meanes, could either he, or any other writer ſpeake of things done ſo longe after, truely to repart them done ſo longe before, If he had bene the greateſt Prophet that euer was. Therefore both the Teſtimony of him, and Peter Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacenſis alſo muſt needs, (to be true) haue relation to theſe dayes of ſainct Manſuetus, and his Aſſociats, or others liuing in thoſe times, and ſent hither by ſainct Peter. Or els how can we allowe, and commend the ſpirituall loue and charitie of ſainct Peter that moſt glorious Apoſtle, whom we may not controle, or of this holy ſainct our Contryman made Preiſt, and Bishop by him to this his moſt beloued contry, if he had continually ſtayed at Tullum, ſo farre hence, or there abouts, neuer coming hither to releeue the extreame ſpirituall needs, diſtreſſes, and miſeries of this his natiue contry, except others were then aſſigned by the ſame Apoſtle to ſupply and performe that charge? In ſuch a caſe the Order of Chriſtian charitie had otherwiſe ſent him hither, and ſo required both of ſainct Peter and this his diſciple, to preferre this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their heauenly loue. That ſpirit which moued holy Moyſes to ſay to <note place="margin">Exod. c. 32. v. 32.</note> God: <hi>Aut miſerere populo huic, aut dele me de libro quem ſcripſiſti: Either take mercy vpon this people</hi> (my contry men) <hi>or blot me out of the booke, which thou haſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>

So he could not poſſibly be that firſt Apoſtle, by whoſe holy meanes and labours we had many Chriſtians of this Nation longe before, in the time of Claudius at the leaſt, as theſe Proteſtants before haue proued, diuers yeares before the beginning of Nero his gouernment. Beſides, theſe Proteſtants doe aſſure vs, that Britaine fell in the diuiſion of the world among the twelue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <note place="margin">S. Paul could not be the firſt that preached in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> following the auncient Fathers in that matter: of which number S. Paul was not, but extraordinary called to be an Apoſtle as S.

Act. Apoſtol.</note> other matters in Religion. And S. Paul himſelfe putteth vs out of all doubt, that he was not preſent with the reſt of the holy Apoſtles, when this diuiſion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7552:38"/> of the world was made, among them. For longe after that time writing to the Galathians, he ſaith: <hi>Neyther went I vp to Hieruſalem to them, which were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Galat. cap. 1. v. 17. 18. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>before me, but I went into Arabia, and returned againe vnto Damaſus. Then after three yeares, I went vp to Hieruſalem to ſee Peter, and abode with him fifteene dayes. But other ef the Apostles ſawe I none, ſaue Iames the Lords Brother.</hi> Thus S. Paul, as our Proteſtants by our Kings allowance tranſlate him. Therefore moſt certaine it is, he was no partie in this diuiſion, of which theſe Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts haue thus informed vs, wherein this kingdome of Britaine fell out within the diuiſion of one of the twelue Apoſtles. And except all men of learning, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and others be deceaued, in teaching that S. Peter firſt conuerted the Romans to the faith of Chriſt, S. Paul giueth to him, the honour of that Chriſtianitie which the Britans had: for writing to the Romans he ſaith, <hi>I</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1. v. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>thanke my God through Ieſus Christ for you all, that your faith is ſpoaken of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world.</hi> Therefore except the Romans did not receaue the faith from S. Peter, which no man will, or with any probabilitie, can affirme, or Britaine then was no part of the knowne world, a thing euidently vntrue, being then both knowne, and in a great part ſubiect to the Roman Empire. It was neyther S. Paul, nor S. Simon Zelotes, but S. Simon Peter, that eyther by himſelf or his holy Diſciples firſt preached heare.

And if no Chriſtianitie had bene knowne heare, which theſe Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts haue already diſproued, vntill this time, yet he coming with S.

An other Proteſtant hiſtoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> citing that very place of Nicephorus, writeth thereof in this manner, <hi>Nicephorus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d booke, that one Simon Zelotes came likewiſe into Britaine,</hi> where by that his diminitiue additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But all our hiſtorians of Antiquitie printed, &amp; Manuſcripts, which I haue ſeene, many, both of our Brittans and Saxons agree with the whole Latine Church, with all Martyrologes, that be auncient, as that of the Romans, Ado, Vſuardus, and others, that: <hi>Natalis Beatorum Apoſtolorum Simonis Chananaei, &amp; Thadaei qui &amp; Iudas dicitur: Quorum Simon in Aegypto Thadaeüs in Meſopotamia Euangelium praedicauit, deinde in Preſidem ſimul ingreſsi, cum innumeram gentis il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius multitudinem Chriſti ſubdidiſſent martyrium conſummarunt. The natiuitie</hi> (ſo the Church nameth the happy Martyrdome and death of Saints) <hi>of the bleſſed Apoſtles, Simon of Chananee, and Thadaeus who is called Iudas the</hi> 28. <hi>day of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: of the which Simon preached the ghospell in Egypt, Thadaeus in Meſopotamia, then entering together into Perſia, when they had made an innumerable multitude of that Nation ſubiect to Chriſt, they conſummated martyrdome.</hi> So hath S. Bede in his Martyrologe: ſo haue all auncient Calenders of Britans and Saxons. So hath the whole Latine Church in the feſtiuitie of this holy Apoſtle, &amp; to bind all English Chriſtians, as well Catholiks by the Rules before, as Proteſtants by the commaunding ſquares of their Religion, the Parlament, and their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p n="5">5. And this is the auncient opinion of the fathers, concerning this holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, that he with S.

That Craton their Diſciple wrote their liues, which Iulius Africanus tranſlated into Latine, and after many miracles there wrought, they were there martyred togeather with S.

And ſo at the coming of ſainct Peter to Rome, this holy place was the howſe, and habitation, of the Chriſtian Brittish parents, of that renowned Lady Claudia, which then liued as hoſtages at Rome, to the Emperour, for this lande, and kingdome of Britaine, and by that meanes it was their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and honor, to giue the firſt entertainement to the bleſſed Apoſtle ſainct Peter, at his firſt coming thither; as that Roman tradition of that their howſe after by marriage with the holy Brittish Lady Claudia their daughter and heire with Pudens the Senator, and ſo long after this coming of ſainct Peter to Rome named the howſe of Pudens, the Senator, aſſureth vs. Which I proue by an other vndoubted tradition of the Romans: <hi>That S.

And if the Martyrologe could carry that interpretation, to vnderſtand by <hi>Apoſtolis, the Apoſtles,</hi> in the plurall number, one Apoſtle (no propper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) yet by this frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly &amp; more then lawfull interpretation, he muſt needs be baptized by S.

And to put all out of doubt, this S. Pudens as I shall demonſtrate hereafter in the proper place of him, and ſaint Claudia his wife, was either an infant, or not borne when S. Peter came to Rome; and was firſt lodged and receaued in that howſe, which after many yeares by title of marriage with our Lady the Lady Claudia came to be his howſe, &amp; not before, but it ſtill remayned in the hands of our Chriſtian Britanes the Parents of that Lady there in Rome.

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7552:45"/> Therefore Pudens being ſo young in the end of Nero his Empire, Although we graunt him then newly married, yet this was by all computations at the leaſt 24. yeares after the coming of ſainct Peter to Rome. And ſo it could not poſſibly be Pudens, but the parents of Claudia, our Britans, that entertained firſt S. Peter in their houſe at Rome. Who for certaintie being Britans of noble order, &amp; degree, &amp; lyuing in Rome as Hoſtages by all Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they enioyed more freedome, and libertie in matters of Religion, then the Romans did at that time; The Emperours of Rome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor long after, intermedling with the Britans, for matters of Religion, but leauing it voluntarie and free vnto them, as other Tributaries, to vſe the Religion of their Contries, or as they were beſt, and moſt diſpoſed, priuately at the leaſt, euen in Rome itſelfe, without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement. So by the great mercy, &amp; prouidence of God, the ſubiection &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall captiuitie, or reſtraint of diuers theſe our worthie Contrimen, proued to be the moſt happy ſpirituall freedome in Chriſt, both of thoſe our Hoſtages there, &amp; this whole kingdome, afterward conuerted to the true faith, from thence, by this originall, ſo renowned and glorious for euer to this Nation, to haue in Rome it ſelfe the firſt Harbourers &amp; Receauers of that moſt Bleſſed, &amp; higheſt Apoſtle S. Peter. And thus I haue proued directly both againſt the Proteſtant Bishop of England denying it, the truth of that Roman Tradition, that ſainct Peter was firſt with his holy Diſciples receiued in Rome in the houſe which the Romans truely called the houſe of Pudens, after he was <note place="margin">God wyn ſupr.

                  <p>Where we ſee, that the grauitie of the Father in lawe to Pudens, was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his, therefore much more we may preſume from hence, that he was a Chriſtian then the other, by that argument.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7552:46"/> Claudia were then married, as is euident in the auncient Romane Martyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge, and others: And ſeeing by the Romans tradition, and other teſtimonies, the houſe wherein they dwelled, was the cheife lodging if the Apoſtles S. Peter and Paul, and their Succeſſors, vntill in the time of Pope Pius the firſt, it was conuerted to be a Church, we muſt needs accompt S. Linus the Bishop, the third which is here named, to be alſo of that familie for the moſt part. Then how to ſingle forth onely S. Eubulus, which here is firſt eyther for pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nobilitie, or that he was the cheife paterfamilias, owner and Maſter of that houſe, or all, and make him a ſtranger there, I cannot finde it by S. Paul, onely repeating them of one family, or any other warrant. For it is plaine here by the Apoſtle, that he was a cheife and principall Chriſtian in Rome, and firſt named among theſe worthies, and before S. Linus, a Bishop then, &amp; Pudens a Senatour, and abſolutely there ſet downe, as their cheifeſt receauer, friend, or patron, which cannot agree to any other, better then to the Father of S. Claudia, this father in lawe to her husband Pudens and firſt entertainer of S. Peter the Apoſtle in Rome, by the Romans tradition. For neyther Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotheus, the continuator of Florentius Wigornienſis, nor any other that write of the Diſciples there, place him among Clergie men, and S.

                  <p n="7">7. To ſtrengthen this opinion, we may add, that S. Paul ſendeth to <hi>S.

Sometimes in other places Baronius faith, S. Priſcilla was wife to S. Pudens, and mother to S. Nouatus, Pudentiana, and Praxedes: ſo likewiſe doth Zepherinus Binius, when it is euident before, that S. Claudia our Brittish Lady was the onely wife, of S. Pudens, and Mother to thoſe Saints. Therefore to excuſe the one from errour, and the other from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7552:47"/> contradiction, they muſt holde, that both the Mother of S. Claudia, and she herſelfe alſo was ſometimes called Priſcilla, as she was in Vmbria termed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binella, of her husbands houſe at Sabinum there. And this may ſufficiently be gathered from thoſe Antiquities, Baronius citeth, in which one S. Priſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la is called Priſcilla Seniour, the elder, or old Priſcilla, to make which iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, we muſt haue alſo Priſcilla Iunior, the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger or you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Priſcilla, &amp; this is vſuall for diſtinction ſake, where the mother and daughter, Father &amp; ſonne be of one, and the ſame name, to call the Father and Mother by their name with the addition, old, or elder, and the ſonne and daughter, with the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, younge, or younger added vnto them. And there be other diſtinctions betweene theſe two: The eldeſt (grandmother to thoſe holy children,) as the Roman Martyrologe with others teſtifieth, who died at Rome hauing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <note place="margin">Martyrol. Rom. die 16.

Of the other, the younger, if by any called Priſcilla, we finde no ſuch obſeruation, nor that she died at Rome, but quite otherwiſe, that after her husband S. Pudens death, she liued ſo longe at his houſe at Sabinum, in Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria, that she thereupon tooke her name Sabellina, and by all writers dyed there farre from Rome. Secondly S. Paſtor who liued in the Apoſtles time, &amp; familiarly in that our Brittish houſe, as I shall shewe in due place, is witneſſe, euen Baronius acknowledging it, That the elder S. Priſcilla Grandmother to S. Nouatus, Tymotheus, Pudentiana, and Praxedes, which were S. Claudia her children, was foundreſſe of that renowned Church-yard, <hi>in via Salaria,</hi>

Peter, (thus receaued in Rome by our Brittish Countrymen) ſent into theſe parts of the world, next adiacent vnto this Iland; That if we finde, the firſt preachers of the faith of Chriſt, in all theſe Countries next vnto vs, were ſent by ſainct Peter ſo well acquainted with our Roman Britans, we may boldely conclude, that this kingdome alone was not left vnremembred, in thoſe holy Ambaſſages. Our Proteſtant Antiquaries from S. Innocentius twelue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares ſince, and other Antiquities, acknowledge it for ſo certaine, and vndoubted a truth. <hi>Quis neſciat, cum ſit manifeſtum, that no man can be ignorant of it, being manifeſt: But S.

The French and German writers, both Catholiks and Proteſtants teſtifie: <hi>Britannos, Normannos, Picardos, omnemque maris Oceani tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum inſtruxit formanitque ſide ſanctus Nicaſius, à ſancto Clemente Apoſtolus illuc delegatus, Imperante Nerone: ſainct Nicaſius being ſent thither Apoſtle in the tyme of Nero by ſainct Clement, did inſtruct and forme in the faith the Britans, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Picards, and all the coaſte of the Ocean Sea.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe all the next parts of the continent, and make ſure worke, that no preachers of the faith of Chriſt did or could come hither, but from S. Peter, and his Apoſtolike See of Rome; If we circuite France, and Spayne, and returne that way into Italy againe, we shall finde it ſo. For although we reade, that S. Iames the Apoſtle was in Spayne, yet it was before the Gentils were preached vnto, and profited not there in that kinde but left the labour and glory thereof to ſainct Peter. The publike Acts of ſainct Iames his life beare record: <hi>Hispaniam adijſſe, &amp; ibi aliquos ad fidem conuertiſſe, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiarum illius prouincia traditio eſt: ex quorum numero ſeptem poſtea epiſcopi a beato Petro ordinati in Hiſpaniam primi directi ſunt: It is the tradition of the Churches of that prouince, that ſainct Iames the Apoſtle went into Spayne, and there conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome to the faith: of which number ſeuen were after made Bishops by ſainct Peter, and were the firſt were ſent thither.</hi> The Romane Martyrologe, Vſuardes ſainct Beda, Ado, Pope Gregory the ſeuenth in his epiſtle to kinge Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, or Adelphonſus, Vincentius and others haue the like, and name thoſe ſeuen Bishops ordeynad by S. Peter and by him ſent into Spayne to be theſe: <hi>Torquatus, Creſiphontes, Secundus, Indaletius, Caecilius, Heſichius, and Euphaſius.</hi> Amonge whome Pope Gregory writeth of theſe Bishops ſent into Spayne by ſainct Peter: <hi>Deſtructa Idololatria, Chriſtianitatem fundauere, &amp; Religionem plantuere, &amp; ordinem &amp; officium oſtendere: hauing deſtroyed Idolatrie, they fownded Chriſtianitie, and planted Religion, and shewed order and dutie.</hi> The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Spannish hiſtorye of Spayne, Beuter and others write that ſainct Iames conuerted there onely 9. parſons, and ſpeaking of the time of Claudius longe before ſainct Paule came to Rome, affirme: <hi>Sainct Saturnine S. Peters diſciple, was ſent into Spayne, he which was the firſt Bishop of Tholoſe: who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Now let vs wynde nearer to Italy, and goe to Marſeils, where we finde that renowned hiſtory of S. Lazarus, and Maximinus coming thither with ſainct Mary Magdalen, and her Siſter ſainct Martha. That theſe two holy Bishops were alſo directed by ſainct Peter, we cannot doubt, when we finde it proued by many Authours, that ſainct Maximinus was <hi>vnus ex</hi>

And after their coming vnto Marſeils, their dependance of ſainct Peter (then being come to Rome) was no leſſe then before, for the French Antiquities tell vs, <hi>That after the Aſcenſion of our Lord an.</hi> 14. <hi>the Iewes raiſed ſo horrible a perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, that the most part fled whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could.

Cedoyne borne blynde whome our Lord made to ſee, and committed themſelues to the Sea, to auoyde the fury of the Iewes, they arriue at Marſeils,</hi> after by the perſuaſion of ſainct Mary Magdalen, the Prince of Marſeils was Chriſtened, and went to Rome, and was there directed by ſainct Peter. And this Iorney of King or Duke Stephe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Fraunce to ſainct Peter at Rome to excuſe himſelfe of the Martyrdome of ſainct Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria his wife, when he was a Pagan, is the common opinion of French Hiſtorians, treating of that time. Therefore we cannot Queſtion, but thoſe holy Bishops ſainct Maximinus, and Lazarus, who thus directed others, ſo greate a Iorney to Rome to be inſtructed, and receaue directions from S. Peter there, were in the ſame caſe of dependancie from him themſelues.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thus wee haue compaſſed all the Sea coaſts of Italy, Spayne, Fraunce round about, and finde all places furnished with holy preachers from ſainct Peter and the See Apoſtolik of Rome.

Lamenting, crying, and deſolation was euery where. Churches are burned, monaſteries deſtroyed, Preiſts driuen away from their ſeates, be wayling the common miſery, lay hid in deſart places. Among whom a venerable man Brithwold Bishop of wincheſter moorning and ſadd entring into the Monaſtarye of Glastenbury, continued in prayers, and pſalmes. Who on a certaine time when he powred forth his prayers, and teares, for the deliuery of the kingdome and people.

And how could the Edict of Claudius concerne S. Peters either expulſion, or keeping out of Rome? when both by the Scripture, Ioſephus, Oroſius, Ado, &amp; others, it onely concerned the tumultuous Iewes; <hi>Claudius Imperator Iudaeos tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuantes à Roma expulit: Claudius the Emperor expelled the Tumultious Iewes from Rome?</hi> for S.

And though no good Chriſtian can thinke, that our cheife Paſtor S.

                     <hi>being the mouer.</hi> Therefore ſeeing the Iewes were expelled for tumults they made, and we are aſſured that the Chriſtians were in no wiſe Agents in theſe tumults, Claudius could not expell them vnder that pretence.

Peter, he addeth: <hi>Anno eiuſdem nono expulſos per Claudium vrbe Iudaeos Ioſephus reſert. Sed me magis Suetonius mouet, qui ait hoc modo: Claudius Iudaeos Impulſore Chriſto aſsiduè tumultuantes Roma expulit. Quod vtrum contra Chriſtum tumultuantes Iudaeos coerceri &amp; comprimi iuſſerit, an etiam Chriſtianos ſimul velut cognatae religionis homines voluerit expelli, nequaquam diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernitur: Ioſephus relateth, that Claudius expelled the Iewes out of the citie, in the ninth yeare of his Reigne. But Suetonius moueth me more, who ſaith in this manner: Claudius expelled forth of Rome the Iewes, dayly making tumults, Chriſt mouing. Which is not decerned whether he commanded the Iewes that made tumults against Christ to be corrected, and ſuppreſſed, or would alſo haue the Chriſtians, men in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſome what like the Iewes to be alſo expelled.</hi> This is all he ſaith, and which others ground vpon, and this later conſtruction as I haue proued before, moſt needs giue place to the former, which keepeth the Chriſtians in fauour with Claudius, and free from Banishment; which is confirmed by Suidas and others: he writeth in Claudius in this manner: <hi>Cum ſub eo Iudaei ſeditionem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>

Of this opinion is the firſt Proteſtant Archbishop of Canterbury, and the preſent, that is Director of the Authour of the bookes of the pretended conſecration of their Bishops, the Author of that Booke, the writers of their Theater, and others.

Paule came, although as a priſoner firſt to Rome, or any other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle thither or to any weſterne Nation. For as I haue proued before, S. Peter going vp to Hieruſalem by Reuelation, at the death of the bleſſed virgin, did ſtaye but a short time there, and in the Eaſterne parts in that Iorney, but the chardge of the weſterne world being more peculiarly committed vnto him before, he returned vnto it to diſchardge this dutie heare; and allthough S. Simon Metaphraſtes bringeth him back againe by Rome, yet he ſpeaketh of no ſtay he made there at this time, but preſently bringeth him into Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>

So there be three things eſſentiall, true Miniſters, the puer word of God preached, and Sacraments duely miniſtred, among which the two laſt depend vpon the firſt, true and lawfull Miniſters. For where true and Orthodoxall Miniſters are, and accordingly preach the word, and Miniſter the Sacraments, there the puer word muſt needs be preached, and Sacraments duely miniſtred. And contrariewiſe where ſuch Miniſters are not, there theſe things cannot be poſſibly by ſuch performed.

Lambert the Proteſtant Antiquary doth aſſure vs, that this Church by Canterbury dedicated to S. Martine, was both builded in the Romans time, and was, and continued a Bishops See, vntill the coming of the Normans hither, and ſo extraordinarily there were two Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops Sees in one City, this being ſubſtitute to the Archbishop, which argueth how greate the honour was, that this nation gaue vnto him. And yet a Church ſo aunciently dedicated to him heare, would of it ſelfe by Brittish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in ſuch affaires, induce vs to thinke, that eyther he was a Britan borne, or preached in this our Britayne, or both. For in peruſing our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of thoſe times, we shall hardly finde any Church dedicated in this kingdome to any Saint, except the bleſſed Virgin Mary, for her eminent priuiledge, but to ſuch as were Saints of this Nation, as S.

                  <p n="7">7. To make which more apparantly probable vnto vs, we haue two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and annuncient Authors, Methodius and S. Marianus, who ſpeaking <note place="margin">Marian. Scot. l. 2. aetat. 6. in Nerua Imp. col. 254. Method. apud cund. ſupr.</note> of this holy Bishop S. Martine, and telling he liued and ſuffered Martyrdome in the time of Nerua the Emperour within the firſt hundred yeare of Chriſt, ſay; That <hi>non ſolum propria prouincia, ſed &amp; in extremis &amp; vltimis induſtrius &amp; illuſtris non ſolùm confeſsione, quin &amp; martyrio exiſtens regna Tyrannorum vicit: He was not onely induſtrious and renowned in his owne Prouince, but alſo in the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and laſt Regions, not onely a confeſſour, but a Martyr, conquered the kingdomes of Tyrants.</hi> Therefore to graunt vnto Ado, that he was ſometime Bishop of Vienna in Fraunce, ſeeing ſo greate authoritie doth warrant vs, that he preached <hi>in extremis, &amp; vltimis,</hi> not onely in one prouince, but the very laſte and vttermoſt, in reſpect of that place, which muſt needes comprehend this Iland of Britayne, we may not now exclude him from hence, where he hath bene honored with a Church dedicated to him as an holy Bishop, ſo many hundreds of yeares aboue 1400. ſince, in a Nation ſo peculiarly honoring the memories of the renowned Apoſtles, and Saints thereof, with ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of loue and duitie. And this the rather, becauſe we are told by forrain writers, that he was not onelie <hi>Apoſtolorum diſcipulus: a diſciple of the Apoſtles</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Arnold. Mitm. Theatr.

And this Church being aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently a Bishops See, as the Kentish Proteſtant Antiquary hath told vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and yet without the City of Canterbury, it giueth more ſtrenght to this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7552:65"/> opinion; for all Antiquities agree, that through out the whole kingdome in the time of King Lucius, all the Cathedrall and Epiſcopall Churches were in cyties. Which argueth this See to haue had a more auncient originall, then from that time: for further proofe whereof, the auncient Manuſcript Hiſtory <note place="margin">Hiſtor. Roffen. M. S.</note> of Rocheſter ſaith: <hi>Extra Ciuitatem in parte Orientali eſt Eccleſia Beati Martini, vbi Sedes Epiſcopalis erat: without the city of Canterbury one the Eaſt ſide is the Church of S. Martine, where there was a Bishops See. And Bishop Godwin was the laſt Bishop there in the time of Archbishop Lanfranke, who would not permit any ſucceſſor therein, ſaying that two Bishops might not be in one city. Godwino vlti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo illius Sedis Epiſcopo ſucceſſorem Lanfrancus ſubrogare noluit: dicens, quod in vna ciuitate duo Epiſcopi minime eſſe deberent.</hi> Standing vpon the Canons of the Church, as his reaſon argueth which further confirmeth, this cuſtome to haue bene long more auncient, then the Canons in that behalfe. And ſeeing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Churches ordinarily take their denomination of the firſt Saincts, that were Bishops there, except ſome other extraordinary merits of Saints, and deuotion vnto them giue them this priuiledge; this may be ſome warrant vnto vs, in this caſe, to incline to thinke, this S. Martine eyther preached heare, or ſo well deſerued of this Nation, that we may not eaſily depriue him of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

Peter, giueth no ſwall argument vnto vs, to thinke it had a more auntient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with ſome Relation from the beginning, to that holy Apoſtle; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there were many farre more fit and conuenient places in, or about the City of London to build ſo ſtately a Church, then a deſolate, briery, and thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Iland. And the Church of S. Peter in Cornhill being dedicated to him, and the Cathedrall Church, by all Antiquities, we cannot be of any other minde, but S. Peter had ſome former title vnto that denomination. Which is rather ſtrengthned, in that theſe Proteſtants from Antiquities teſtifie, that Theonus Archbishop of London, in King Lucius time, who had his See at S. Peters in Cornhil, and helped to the building thereof, <hi>preached, read, and miniſtred the Sacraments there, to ſuch as made reſort vnto him in this Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Church.</hi> A Proteſtant Antiquary writeth. <hi>I haue heard, that there are, or haue bene Records in the ſame Abbey</hi> (of Weſtminſter) <hi>which declare it was a Church, before the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans receaued the faith of Chriſt;</hi> He meaneth the time of King Lucius.

And this is confirmed by the knowne viſion, and words of S. Peter the Apoſtle in that place, in the time of S. Ethelbert King of Kent, and S.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EING thus perfectly inſtructed in the truth of S. Ioſeph of Aramathia and his Aſſociats being heare: It followeth next in Order, to be truely informed, from whome, whence, and when he came hither. The opinion of many Proteſtants is, that he was ſent hither out of this Gallia, or France next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iacent vnto vs by Saint Philip the Apoſtle, then preaching there. But as I haue not allowed this ſentence before, ſo I muſt now vtterly diſable it to be receaued for true. Which cannot better be performed then by firſt exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and improuing the reaſons one which it is grounded, and then ſet downe what is moſt probable to be followed in this Queſtion. Some Proteſtants, as <hi>Foxe,</hi> Dauid Powell, Sir Francis Haſtings, and the Theater writers would <note place="margin">Foxe to. 1. Dauid Powell annot. in hiſt. Cambr. p. 12 13. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Haſtings &amp;c.</note> haue their Readers beleeue, that S. Gildas held this opinion that S. Ioſeph was ſent to the Britans out of this next Gallia by S. Philip the Apoſtle. But when we come to finde this teſtimony in Gildas, we can finde no ſuch Gildas to proue it by: for the true Hiſtory of Gildas which is <hi>de Excidio &amp; Conqueſtu Britanniae,</hi> from which diuers of theſe men alledge it, hath no ſuch thing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Gildas pretended by ſome to ſay, that S. Ioſeph was ſent out of France into Britaine by S. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip the Apoſtle, hath no ſuch thing.</note> in the printed booke published by the Proteſtants or Polidor Virgil, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any Manuſcript copy which I can finde, or is cited for this matter. Maſter Foxe writeth thus: <hi>Gildas in his History affirmeth plainely that Britany receaued the Ghoſpell in the time of Tiberius the Emperour: and that Ioſeph of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathia was ſent by Philip the Apoſtle from France to Britayne. Gild. lib. de victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Aurel. Ambroſij.</hi> Maſter Haſtings followeth Foxe as his Maſter word by worde, onely he citing Gildas doth not alledge that booke. And that <note place="margin">Foxe Act. and Monum. to. 1. p. 96.</note> which they cite from Gildas of Britayne receauing the faith in the time of Tiberius, ouerthroweth the credit of this allegation, for they cite both that and Saint Ioſephs ſending hither out of France by S. Philip the Apoſtle from one and the ſame Gildas, and place, in him. And yet that Relation of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7552:73"/> Britayne receauing the faith in the dayes of Tiberius, is in <hi>Gildas de Excidio Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae,</hi> and onely in that and no other auncient Authour, any Gildas or other for any thing I can finde in Antiquitie, or iuſtified or iuſtifiable by any later writer. For beſides the true acknowledged Gildas, of whome I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, called the <hi>wiſe: cognomento ſapiens,</hi> we finde but two others men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in our Hiſtories, one of them liued at Rome and dyed as a Proteſtant Bishop teſtifieth in the yeare of Chriſts Incarnation 74. <hi>vitae compleuit curſum anno ab incarnato Dei verbo</hi> 74.

The other Gildas commonly named Albanius could not be Authour of this pretended Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of S. Philips ſending S. Ioſeph to this Nation: for though I acknowledge, with the Brittish Hiſtory, Ponticus Virunnius, Bale, Pits, and others that this Gildas wrote a booke of that Title, and ſubiect, yet it could not be this which is here produced: for as both the Brittish Hiſtory and Virunnius witneſſe, <hi>the names and Acts of the Roman Legats Damianus and Phugatianus with there Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates</hi>

                     <hi>were ſet downe by Gildas in that booke: eorum nomina &amp; actus i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n libro reperiuntur, quem Gildas de victoria Aurelij Ambroſij inſcripſit.</hi> And yet theſe being ſo memorable things for our Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, not any one of theſe Proteſtants which cite the pretended Gildas before, though all of them wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of purpoſe of ſuch matters, doth make the leaſt memory of them, which they would not haue ſo groſſely omitted, if they had ſeene the true Gildas which was written in that time.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7552:73"/> entreate hereafter; that S. Philip the Apoſtle was neuer in this next France, to ſend S. Ioſeph from thence into Britayne. And no man of any indifferent Iudgment will thinke, but if the true Gildas had written any ſuch thing, the moſt diligent Collectours of the Antiquities of Glaſtenbury; who gathered ſo many and of farre meanner credit, and Antiquitie, then the true Gildas was, would for the honour of that houſe, in one place or other haue remembred it, which none of them, nor any other, old or new credible writer hath done.</p>

Therefore if ſo cheife a man in S. Ioſephs company was in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iudgment, ſo nearely depending of S. Peter the Apoſtle, we may not rashly make the reſt ſuch ſtrangers vnto him, but that they had direction from him in their proceedings, as I haue euidently before proued, and shall make it more manifeſt hereafter, that when they were come hither they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended of him, and his Diſciples in things ſpirituall: And ſuch ſubordination had theſe holy men to the See Apoſtolike of Rome, that when in the time of King Lucius their memory was allmoſt forgotten heare in Britaine, for any thing we finde in Hiſtories, it was renewed from Rome euen as our cheifeſt Proteſtants themſelues acknowledge, among whome their firſt Proteſtant Archbishop affirmeth, that S.

What diſpotion or Inclination theſe had to the faith of Chriſt, I will intreate when I come to their dayes hereafter, in the meane time, William of Malmesbury in his Manuſcript of Glaſtenbury, all other Antiquities of that place, and Hiſtoryes as before generaly ſay, theſe three were <hi>Reges Pagani: Pagan Kings,</hi> which Harding himſelfe confeſſeth of Marius, and Coillus, though friends to Chriſtian Religion, neither doth <note place="margin">Guliel.

And the Authour which before would haue King Marius and Coillus to be conuerted to the faith of Chriſt by S. Ioſeph, doth in an other place with the conſent of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes name <hi>S.

                  <p n="6">6. And if King Marius had bene a Chriſtian, or inclined to that holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it carrieth no probability, that he learned it of S.

But they be Proteſtant and not Catholike writers, which by their weake grownds, and feeble Authorities haue ſo much as in them lieth, made S. Pauls preaching in Britaine to be neither credible, nor probable, both which I haue thus diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and proued it be both poſſible, credible, and probable that he was, and preached in this kingdome.</p>

Timothie Bishop of Epheſus continued at his chardge, and came not hither; and if we should ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the contrary, (contrary to all Antiquitie) yet coming hither with S. Paul, and S. Paul not coming vnto any weſterne part of many yeares after, as I haue made demonſtration before, this diſproueth, and proueth not his purpoſe, ſpeaking of no time at all. And this Authour contradicteth himſelfe in this Relation, for he expreſſely writeth in theſe words: <hi>S.

                  <p n="3">3. That S. Paule did after this his preaching in Spayne, preſently returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the Eaſt Countries, where he had preached before, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not into Britaine at this time, we haue as greate allowance by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, as they are expounded euen by Proteſtant writers, and by their teſtimonies aſwell as other Catholike Authours, and other Antiquities. Firſt the Magdeburgian Proteſtants ſpeaking of that time of S.

The Proteſtant Miniſter and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian of Geneua Francis Burgoing in his French Hiſtorie is of the ſame minde, and vpon the ſame grounds of Scripture: onely he differeth in ſaying, this preaching of S.

                     <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Philem. v. 22.</note> Where we ſee that S. Paul then a Priſoner in Rome was ſo certaine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that he should be deliuered, and come to them in the Eaſte againe, that he ſaith he knoweth it, and that it was to be ſo, ſoone after his deliuery, that though he was firſt to goe into Spaine, yet his aboade there should be ſo shorte, and his returne into the Eaſte ſo ſoone, that he writeth to haue a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging prouided for him againſt his coming thither, which he would not haue done, if he had determined to haue made any long ſtay either in Spaine, or any other place by the way.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I haue shewed from Arnoldus Mirmannius before, that he confidently <note place="margin">Arnold. Mirm. Theatr. Conu. gent.</note> with his Authorities affirmeth, that S. Paul vpon his libertie at Rome went into Syria, Pamphilia, Licaonia, Phoenice, Miſia, Phrygia, Galatia, Bithinia, Achaia, Macedonia, the reſt of Greece and Aſia. Gulielmus Eiſengrenius ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Gulielm.

Paule neither did, nor could come into Britaine vntill after his laſt coming from the Eaſtern Countries, very litle
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7552:92"/> before his Death. For what accompt ſoeuer we will followe of the time, and number of yeares of this trauaile of S. Paul, after he was diſmiſſed from Priſon at Rome, to goe from thence through France, into Spaine, and from thence againe into the Eaſtern Countries, and viſite ſo many Nations there, as I haue remembred, and after to come againe into Spaine from thence into France, and then into Britaine, and yet to goe with ſuch ſpeed from hence, that paſſing through Germany, and Italy, he had bene a Priſoner at Rome no short time, as appeareth by his ſecond Epiſtle to S. Timothie, when he was there martyred by Nero in the later end of his Empire. Our Countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Matthew of Weſtminſter ſaith S.

Timothie, written at that time, as is plaine both in the ſame Epiſtle of his Martyrdome at hand, and other circumſtances there, as both S. Chryſoſtome, S. Athanaſius, Theophilact, and others proue, that he was a Priſoner then no ſmall time at Rome, for he writeth to S. Timothie at Epheſus ſo farre of, to come vnto him, and to bring certaine things with him, which S. Paule had left behinde him in that his Eaſterne Iorney. And exhorteth him thus: <hi>doe thy diligence to come before winter;</hi> and sheweth he had then once ben called to his anſweare. Yet it is certaine, that S. Paul ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liued that winter, and was pute to death, by all teſtimonies, vpon the 29. day of Iune: which muſt needs be at the ſooneſt about a yeare after. And that S. Pauls full intention was at his firſt Impriſonment preſently vpon his libertie to goe to the Hebrues and the Eaſte againe, beſides that is ſaid before, he plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely proteſteth in his Epiſtle to the Hebrues, written at Rome in his firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, when he ſaith: <hi>know yee that our Brother Timothie is ſete at libertie, with whome, if he come shortly, I will ſee you.</hi> Where it is euident that S. Paul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vpon his deliuery preſently to returne into the Eaſterne Countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to viſite the Iewes and Hebrewes there, to whome he write in theſe words, and the whole Epiſtle, and not to come to make any ſtay at that time in any Weſtern Nation, much leſſe Britaine, ſo remote, and diametrically all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtant from all thoſe Countries.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And when he returned from this his Eaſterne Iorney againe, it is euident by his owne teſtimonie that he was taken, and kept a Priſoner at Rome againe ſoone after his returne from the Eaſt, that if he came into Britaine at all, he <note place="margin">If S. Paul was in Britaine, his ſtay was very short.</note> had no time betweene that Eaſtern Iorney and ſecond Captiuitie to make any aboade heare. For in his ſecond Epiſtle to S. Timothie when he was a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner euen vntill his Martyrdome, he writeth, as though he was newly come forth of the Eaſt at that time, writing to S. Timothy to haue <hi>the cloake and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. v. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>parchments brought vnto him which he left at Troas with Carpus.</hi> And ſpeaking againe of that his late Iorney, he ſaith: <hi>Eraſtus aboade at Corinth: But Trophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus haue I left at Miletum ſicke.</hi> Theſe he writeth as late accidents in that Iorney, which he would not haue done, if after his coming from thence, there had bene ſo greate diſtance of time, that he might, and did come to make any long ſtay in this kingdome. And that he did not come hither after this, but continued a Priſoner to his death at Rome, it is euident before, and he in this Epiſtle thus confirmeth it: <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my depa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

And allthough we had diuers holy Chriſtians then in Rome of this Nation, which reiected Martial his Poems, as S. Claudia, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7552:96"/> her Father did; yet there were alſo at that time many Pagan Britans, and ſome of them alſo Poets, as Gildas Cambrius, a moſt noble Britan Poet, as Ponticus <note place="margin">Pontic.

Pauls doctrine, ſo oppoſite vnto ſuch vanities: and ſo she knowne to be ſo renowned a Chriſtian when Martial wrote, and ſo highely commended by S.

And allthough I willingely allowe, what a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Bishop writeth of her, placing her among our Brittish writers, and affirming, that she was renowned all through out Italy, and other Nations, for her ſtyle in the Latine, &amp; Greeke tongue: <hi>Claudia Rufina Britannici generis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliſſima</hi>

For euery one that hath knowledge in Latine, and Greeke, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in a more excellent manner, then a Lady, a ſtranger to them both, and young in yeares, as by theſe men she was, is not a fit Tranſlator of holy Scripturs, and we doe not finde that honor then giuen to any of her ſexe, nor did that, or ſuch office belong to her or any ſuch; her Father before confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a learned Chriſtian, was a fitter man to performe ſuch things to this his Nation, if any ſuch was done at that time. But amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all the Epiſtles which S.

Pauls Epiſtles, nor any part of Scripture will make an Infidell a good Chriſtian without a Preacher or Interpreter. And I ſuppoſe he would be thought a ſtrange Poet ſurpaſſing Martiall in that kind, in the iudgment of Antiquaries, who should ſay, he had euer ſeene, or credibly heard of any part of Scripture then tranſlated, much more by any woman into the Welch or Brittish languadge.</p>

Peter. <hi>Intellexit Petrus de ſua dictum paſsione, quod in ea Chriſtus paſſurus videretur qui patitur in ſingulis: non vtique corporis dolore, ſed quadam miſericordiae compaſsione, aut gloriae celebritate.</hi> And this cannot be well conſtrued to be that admonition of his death which S. Peter wrote off in his Epiſtle, being both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and in all probable Iudgment after the writing of that his Epiſtle, and immediatly before his apprehenſion, and death, as appeareth by thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, affirming S.

Peter by Chriſt of his death, we finde no other, but that moſt cleare and manifeſt foretelling thereof to S. Peter, by an holy Angel in Britaine, we muſt needs conclude that the holy Apoſtle in that paſſadge of his Epiſtle, how he should shortly leaue the Tabernacle and dwelling place of his ſoule, his mortall body, as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had shewed vnto him, did this Nation that honour, to remember in his holy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that foreſight and admonition of his end approaching made vnto him by the heauenly viſion and Inſtruction thereof, which he had in Britaine. And ſignifiing in the firſt words of this his laſte Epiſtle that he wrote it to all beleeuing Chriſtians at that time, ſaying: <hi>Simon Peter a Seruant and an Apoſtle</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Petr. 1. v. 1. 2.</note>

                     <hi>be multiplied.</hi> We muſt needs acknowledge, that coming then immediately from the Chriſtians in this Nation, whome he had ſo lately conuerted, he moſt fatherly remembred them with others in thoſe words, and the whole Epiſtle following, eſpecially where he writeth: <hi>I thinke it meete, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to ſtirre you vp, by putting you in remembrance. Knowing that</hi>

Moreouer, I will endeuour that you may be able after my deceaſe, to haue theſe things allwayes in remembrance.</hi> In which wordes this our kingdome of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine doth moſt iuſtly claime, that S. Peter remembred it, and rather then any other, citing there the admonition, which he receaued by the holy Angell heare, and there proteſteth his greate care he had of this Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, that it might not onely during his life but after his death remaine conſtant in the profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion. And by Oecumenius and diuers others, both the Greeke and Latine Text giuing way to that expoſition, S.

For the Romans did not intermeddle then with the Britans in matters of Religion, but left ſuch affaires to their owne Gouernment, and Brittish Gouernours, as we ſee in their Kings then <hi>Aruiragus, Marius, Coillus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> all friends and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers <note place="margin">That neither S.

                  <p n="3">3. By which meanes it ſeemeth, that the number of our Apoſtolike men, though their names be buried in obliuion, by iniquitie of time, was againe <note place="margin">S.

Therefore the auncient writers, and Antiquities of this Hiſtorie ſay, that within few yeares <note place="margin">M. S. antiq. de Vit. S. Ioſeph ab Aramathia. Io. Capgrau. in eod. Antiquit.

And ſecondly after the death of Cletus, when it was impoſed vpon him againe, the ſecond time, and died in that dignitie: as Martinus Polonus and others write. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens quamuis à beato Petro eſſet electus, tamen coegit Linum &amp; Cletum ante ſe pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificari.

The firſt was the weſt part of the Iland, the ſecond Kent, the third Flauia called alſo Mertia, The fourth Maximia that is to ſay Yorke, The fift Valentia, Albaniae now corruptly named Scotland. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Citie of the firſt Britaine was Caerlegion. The Metropolitan of the ſecond Dorobernia now Canterbury. In the third London. In the fourth Yorke. In the fift Alba taken to be the Citie now named S. Andrewes.</hi> Thus farre Giraldus out of S. Anacletus Tome extant in his time as he hath witneſſed, both in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and Imperiall Decrees.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And this diuiſion of this Iland into fiue Metropolitan Sees, according to S. Anacletus diuiſion, was obſerued by S.

And without theſe by the teſtimony of S. Anacletus, warranted therein by S. Peter, as he hath told vs, the grace and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7552:112"/> power of the holy Ghoſt was not giuen in that Sacrament. And ſo where it is wanting, as in our Proteſtants of England and all other Heretikes, there can be no true and lawfull Bishops, no Preiſts made by ſuch as be not ſo conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no Sacraments duely miniſtred, no word of God truely and orderly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, euen by the Articles of the English Proteſtant Religion, diſabling in <note place="margin">Articles of Engl.

And as I haue ſpoaken of Cambridge, ſo we may more then probably hold of our other Schooles, or Vniuerſities in this our Britaine then, namely Stamford founded by King Bladud and furnished with Philoſophers of Athens by him, and ſo continued a place of learning vntill the coming of S. Auguſtine hither, when it was by the Pope of Rome interdicted for Hereſies. Glamorgan before the firſt Arriuall of Iulius Caeſar heare. Eridon or Criclade, and perhaps others. For beſides our owne Writers teſtifying theſe things, Plutarch and other Groe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are witneſſes, that the learned Groecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had much reſort into theſe parts, euen this our Britaine before the birth of Chriſt. And Velleius Paterculus is witnes, that the learned Groecians diſperſed themſelues into many Countries, and Cities to encreaſe learning. <hi>Corpora gentis illius ſeparata ſunt in alias Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.</hi> And Vitrunnius a Roman Writer plainely with the truth confeſſeth, that our Britaine before Chriſts time euer loued learning, and had their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned men both for Greeke and Latine learning, <hi>vnicum eſt in tot &amp; tantis turbinibus verum ſemper litteras amauit, &amp; vtraque lingua ſaepè plurima floruerunt magni vates, ſicut Plenidius Oronius.</hi> And all Hiſtories forreine and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Chriſtian and Pagan, Catholike and Proteſtant are full, what a learned Sect, that of the Druids was, how they florished in France, and of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Nation, contending with Greece itſelfe for prioritie and preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie therein, and yet, that the principall and cheifeſt of that profeſſion, were heare in Britaine, therefore ſeeing they were with all mankinde borne in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, not learned but to learne, and God did not, doth not, will not mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly <note place="margin">Many Learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Britaine in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Schools be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Cambridge now conuerted.</note> infuſe knowledge to ſuch men his Enemies, we muſt needs allowe them Accademies, Shooles, learning, and teaching places to be firſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and then inſtruct others in ſo many Arts and ſciences, for whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they are ſo much by all Antiquaries commended.</p>

What was the encreaſe of Chriſts Church and Seruants heare in Britaine <note place="margin">The great encreaſe of Chriſtians, in Britaine in the time of theſe Popes.</note> in their time, we may eaſily coniecture by that which hath bene ſayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſo many learned men conuerted heare to the faith in the very later end of their immediate Predeceſſor, which in all Iudgments muſt needs be much more verified of the dayes of theſe Popes: for the cheife learned men and of their principall Schoole for learning, being thus conuerted to Chriſt, &amp; as we haue bene told before, <hi>became Preachers of the Ghospell heare in Britaine,</hi>

Which Ihon Harding in his auncient Chronicle doth manifeſtly declare, though not citing his Authours, when recounting how the Archflaming Seats, were turned to Archbisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priks, and thoſe of Flamins 28. in number, into ſo many Bishopriks, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thus addeth: <hi>all theſe workes Eugeny confirmed.</hi> Then if Pope Eugenius or <note place="margin">Harding. Chron. f. 43. c. 51.</note> Higinius confirmed and allowed theſe affaires, and proceedings, we muſt needs yeeld, they were in a greate forwardnes in this his time. No man can reaſonably ſay, that the name Eugeny is miſtaken for Eleutherius, for there is no proportion betweene thoſe two names, for any Authour, Scribe, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to commit ſo greate an error, eſpecially no man correcting it, as an eſcape in writing, and to aſſure vs heareof, the ſame Authour maketh mention in <note place="margin">Hard. ſupr.</note> the ſame Page both of Eleutherius, calling him by our English phraſe Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thery, and Higinius by the ſame manner of our languadge naming him, as before Eugeny which confirmed theſe things. And it is no maruaile, or any ſingular thing, but vſuall and the ordinary common courſe for Popes to giue ſuch order before hand, how things shall be ſetled, when there is ſuch hope of happy proceedings, and Apoſtolike men taking the chardge in hand, as heare it was at this time, if God shall ſo cooperate with their labours, and to proceede otherwiſe, is to worke without warrant and Authoritie. So S. Paul writeth to S. Titus, that he had <hi>left him in Crete to conſtitute Bishops or Preiſts in euery Citie;</hi> yet it would be greate and vnwarranted boldnes to ſay, that S.

                  <p n="4">4. Thus it was alſo in the time of S. Auguſtine when he was ſent hither by S. Gregory to the Saxons. He ſent him his Archiepiſpopall Pall to be Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of London, yet he ſeated himſelfe after by warrant at Canterbury, and gaue him power <hi>to ſend an Archbishop to Yorke, if that Country should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue</hi>

Quia ei quoque, ſi vita comes fuerit, Pallium tribuere, Domino fauente, diſponimus.</hi> And yet it is certaine, that S. Auguſtine in his time neuer ſent Archbishop to Yorke, neither did he make aboue two Bishops in his owne Prouince, S. Mellitus at London, and S. Iuſtus at Rocheſter. Neither did S. Gregory liue to ſend a Pall to any Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Yòrke, or ſee any there. Neither euer had that See ſince the Saxons time twelue, or halfe twelue Bishops vnder it. Neither did S. Auguſtine who receaued this warrant for all the Saxons, preuaild ſo farre, nor all that came with him, or after him from Rome to conuert halfe the English Nation, but farre the greater part of them was conuerted by holy Bishops, Preiſts, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, which were of our auncient Hierarchiall Brittish ſucceſſion, and order heare. And allthough I doe not finde it expreſſely affirmed in any Antiquarie but Harding that S. Higinius now Pope did ſo particularly, giue aſſiſtance and direction in this buſines of our Britains Conuerſion, yet many very auncient and renowned Writers giue ſuch teſtimonie herein, that we muſt needs graunt that to be moſt true, which Harding affirmeth, and that after coming Scribes and Copiers of their Hiſtories haue done the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours wronge by their negligence or ignorance in writing one man for another, Eleutherius for Higinius.

Therefore to ſaue ſo many auncient, and worthie Authours, and their Scribes from a double error both of the time, and name of the Pope, to whome King Lucius did now write, we muſt needs lay this ſingle taxe vpon ſuch, as haue Tranſcribed their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that they did miſtake the name of the Pope, writing Eleutherius for Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginius. And this they were more eaſily drawne vnto, becauſe they found, that Pope Eleutherius was a greate Agent in the generall Conuerſion of this Nation, which was long after this time, and their Scribes are more excuſable in this point. And this by their leaue we muſt ſay, or els both wander from the proued truth of this Hiſtorie, and lay a double imputation of miſtaking vpon theſe Authours or their Tranſcribers. For it is euident by all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that S. Eleutherius was not Pope many yeares after this time, which they muſt contradict, if they will maintaine their miſtaking. And where they ſay, that King Lucius wrote to the Pope of Rome in this yeare, they muſt recall that, and ſay he wrote then to no Pope, for Eleutherius was not Pope vntill long after. <note place="margin">King Lucius either actually conuerted, or conſented to be a Chriſtian in the time of Pope Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginius.</note>

                  <p n="5">5. Therefore to giue euery one his due, I may not depriue S.

And this is more confirmed by the Teſtimony of our Countryman Ethelwerdus, who teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that the Pope of Rome which was in the yeare of Chriſt 156. which was S. Higinius ſent letters to King Lucius, and a Legate to him alſo, to the ſame purpoſe exhorting him to be a Chriſtian, to which he conſented, and after performed accordingly. <hi>In ſexto quinquageſimo anno beatiſsimus Chriſti famulus per Nuntium &amp; literas Lucium adijt Inſulae Regem, admonens eum de fide, &amp; baptiſmo Catholico, qui tum Britanniae Regni poteſtatem pollebat: qui etiam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsit verifimili ratione Christianum ſe eſſe futurum, quod &amp; perfecit.</hi> Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that which Harding hath before deliuered, that Pope Higinius did confirme the ſpirituall labours and proceedings in Britaine in this time; for heare is proued that the Pope then, which could be no other, but this holy Saint, did both write his letters, and ſend his Legate hither to ſuch intent, &amp; perſuade the King to Chriſtian Religion. And we are aſſured that in this time both King Lucius ſent to the Pope of Rome, to haue Apoſtolike men ſent hither to preach the faith of Chriſt to his ſubiects heare, and the Pope both by letters and Legate ſollicited King Lucius to receaue the Catholike faith and Baptiſme, and he ſo did: <hi>quod &amp; perfecit;</hi> but whether he was actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptiſed at this time, or onely promiſed it now, and performed it after, I am not heare to determine: onely I adde that the very Authours themſelues <note place="margin">Matth.

And were or could ſo many Archflamens &amp; Flamens be conuerted in the generall Conuerſion, and embraced Chriſtian Religion, if none of them had reſigned their places before? Or who can imagine, that King Lucius entered into ſuch a Diſpute of Learning without conſultation with his learned Flamens, and Archflamens, which then ruled not onely in ſpirituall but temporall affaires? Or how could he, and his temporall Nobles be conuerted, except the others were firſt conuicted to be in error? How can it with credibilitie be conceaued, that ſo many of thoſe cheife Gentile Preiſts should willingly relinquish their profeſſions, and moſt of them be made and conſecrated Chriſtian Preiſts and Bishops by the common opinion, except many of them had profeſſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie before?

And allthough iniquitie of times hath buried both the names, &amp; labours of moſt of theſe Apoſtolike men in obliuion, for their particulars, yet we cannot but conſider it was a great comfort to the Chriſtians heare, and motiue to others to embrace the faith, when they did ſo certainely vnderſtand by ſuch approued warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that many Noble men in Rome were become Chriſtians, and boldly profeſſed that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And among other matters concerning Britaine cettified to S. Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy by S. Paſtor, this was an other, that S. Pius Pope, S. Paſtor and S. Praxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des being preſent in the ſikenes of S. Nouatus, he bequeathed all his Ritches and ſubſtance to his Brother S. Timothie and Siſter S. Praxedes: <hi>his diebus cum ibi eſſemus, hoc placuit ei, vt vobis vna cum beata Praxede omnem ſubſtantiam ſuam relinqueret.</hi> And S. Paſtor by the conſent of Pope Pius and S.

We haue heard before, that by the paynes and preaching of him, and our Countryman ſaint Marcellus, both our King Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius became a Chriſtian, and a great part of Britaine began to profeſſe the faith of Chriſt: <hi>S. Lucius Britanniae Rex S. Timothei eruditione ad Religionem Chriſti in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductus eſt. Britannia magnam ex parte fidem Chriſti profiteri caepit:</hi> And the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuering of ſaint Timothie ſo ſeriouſly and with ſuch intentiue feruour, that no thing could ſeparate him from that moſt Heroicall Enterpriſe, not the death of his deareſt Siſter and Brother S. Pudentiana and Nouatus, nor ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Noble a Patrimonie now fallen vnto him, aſſureth vs, if we had no other teſtimonie to adheare vnto, that he was now Father of many ſpirituall children, had many ſuch Brothers and Siſters, and by labouring long heare among the ſtones and Rocks of Britaine, had founde out and procured to this kingdome greater and more enduring Mines of Treaſure, then all ſaint Pudens and Claudia his parents, or ſaint Nouatus his Brother their wordly Riches could yeeld vnto him. I can hardly be drawne to other opinion, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no reaſon to warrant mee, but his inflamed loue to the ſpirituall good, and happines of Britaine bounde and fixed him heare, with the chaines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vntill with vnexpreſſible Ioy he did ſee and reape that fruite of his holy works (my Authours before haue told vs of) that by his meanes King Lucius
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7552:133"/> was induced to Chriſtian Religion, and a greate parte of Britaine profeſſed it. And this was the occaſion of his returne from hence and going to Rome, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by that Iorney to be the happy Meſſenger and Inſtrument of relating <note place="margin">His returne to Rome, and occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof.</note> and procuring that, which was reſerued for the honour of ſaint Eluanus, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duuinus, Damianus, Fugatianus and their Aſſociats after, to ſee, and effect, the generall and publickly warranted, both by Pope and Prince, Conuerſion of this Britaine, now hindered for a time by a ſodden and new rayſed ſtorme of Perſecution vnder new Emperours. For allthough at the time of ſaint Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie his beginning his Iorney from Britaine to Rome the Church of Chriſt was at ſome eaſe, and quiet, Antoninus Pius that friend to Chriſtians, yet continuing his Empire, or if Marcus Aurelius Antoninus the perſecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had begun his Empire, yet he had not begun his Perſecution at that time, or the knowledge thereof had not yet trauailed ſo farre as Britaine, to giue warning and notice to King Lucius, of any ſuch thinge, eyther acted or intended. But when he, and his new Chriſtian people heare had for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie learned what barbarous and cruell Perſecutions were now in hand, as all Antiquities of that time doe witnes, and to be ſilent in others, that our Noble Brittish Chriſtian houſe in Rome, which had continued ſo long quiet, and bene ſuch a Seminary of Religion for this kingdome, was now ſo cruelly afflicted, 23. renowned Martyrs tyrannically and without all tryall putt to death in the place and houſe itſelfe, as I haue related, and ſaint Iuſtine and his ſacred company after that, carryed alſo from thence to durance and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſaint Timothie our Apoſtle Countryman and owner of that holy houſe together with ſaint Marke his happy companion in Martyrdome, and likely in his Trauailes in Britaine, were taken from that place to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Pope Pius alſo which much conuerſed there, and should haue bene a cheife meanes in directing and aſſiſting our generall Conuerſion, if it had then taken effect putt to death by theſe Emperours for that cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe and ſuch cruelties euen againſt the Chriſtians of this kingdome by theſe perſecuting Emperours being now knowne in Britaine, there was no hope left of our generall Conuerſion to be compaſſed at this time, ſo many principall Agents therein violently putt to death, and the Emperours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe permiſſion or conniuencie it could not probably be brought to paſſe, ſo enraged and cruell againſt vs, for ſuch things. Yet cannot this ſtay and adiourning of this greateſt publike good of this Nation be imputed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimitie of minde, or want of Heroicall Chriſtian fortitude, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in our Chriſtian King, and diuers of his people and Nobles among them, who, as before, had receaued the Chriſtian faith, and priuately profeſſed it, but to the Iniquitie of the violent and ouerſwaying times and Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours with their Lieutenants, Imperiales, or Proimperatours, Proconſuls, Propretours hindering that holy worke. For allthough the ſtate of Britaine was not ſo ſeruile to the Romans as the condition of many kingdomes was but we euer had our owne Kings both by inheritance and diſcent of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer auncient Brittish regall Race, and with the deſired allowance and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Roman Emperours after the marriadge of King Aruiragus with Genuiſſa daughter of Claudius, and the greateſt dutie they could demande, was their Tribute: yet becauſe in a publike and authoritatiue change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in a whole kingdome, there muſt alſo be a change of ſuch lawes, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, as were contradicting and repugnant vnto the Religion to be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, this could not be done in ſuch perſecuting dayes without greate ielouſie
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7552:133"/> in the Perſecutours Emperours, of an vtter reuolt from them in all reſpects. And therefore our old Manuſcripts both of Nennius, and S. Gildas alſo, as they are commonly reputed, doe tell vs, that when our generall and publike Conuerſion was, there was alſo an Imperiall allowance, permiſſion, or tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it, from the Roman Emperours or their Lieutenants heare. <hi>Miſſa</hi>

Whereas all creaturs cry out vnto vs, eſpecially the more Noble as the Celeſtiall bodies (in ſearching whoſe natures and effects theſe men were moſt conuerſant,) that there is an eternall and omnipotent maker and cauſer which created all things, who being without begining or ending was made or cauſed by no other: <hi>caeli enarrant gloriam Dei, &amp; opera manuum eius annuntiat firmamentum.</hi> And diuine worship is onely due vnto him, for his allmightie excellencie, and the benefites, which man a reaſonable creature receaued, and further expecteth, and needeth to receaue from him, which we commonly call Religion, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeinge, Religation, or dutifull binding of man enformed with a reaſonable intellectuall, and immortall ſoule, ordayned as it were the Lieutenant and Viceroy of God to gouerne this inferiour world, &amp; by his better eternall part, aſſured that better and eternall things are ordayned for him, if he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue himſelfe of them, but ſeeke, finde out and performe the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of ſo infinite good and bountifull a Creatour, Preſeruer and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayner of all things, eſpecially for the vſe and end of man ſo dignified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted among his creaturs.

For when matters of Religion had ſo farre and proſperouſly proceeded in Britaine, as I haue related in the former Chapter, and now nothing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be concluded of in thoſe affaires, but how the true faith and Religion of Chriſt might be planted heare, by the moſt publike, powerable, warrantable, and vncontroleable Authoritie in ſuch proceedings, it was generally agreed vpon according to thoſe grounds and approued Rules which our Proteſtant Antiquaries haue propoſed and preſcribed vnto vs before, that ſo greate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and generall a buſines of conuerting a whole, and ſo Lardge a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome neither lawfully might, or could be eſtablish in all things thereto requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and neceſſarie, without the help, power and higheſt warranting prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of the Roman See Apoſtolike. And therefore the finall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our King, his Nobles, and moſt Religious and wiſeſt Aduiſers in this Noble worke, was, to petition to the Pope of Rome by letters and Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors from hence, that he would accordingly as his high Paſtorall charge and office called vpon him in ſuch affaires, to take this greate Action in hand, and effect it by ſuch men and meanes as should be thought moſt fit, and approued vnto him. Whether this Reſolution and Ambaſſadge of King Lucius was made and directed firſt at this time in the Papacie of S. Eleutherius, or toward the later end of Pope Soter, I dare not to determine, becauſe we reade in the beſt and moſt allowed Relation of this Ambaſſadge, that it was now acted in the very beginning of the Popedome of Eleutherius, and then both King Lucius letters and Ambaſſadors were come to Pope Eleutherius at Rome, with this ſuite. <hi>Huic</hi> (Eleutherio) <hi>initio Pontificatus ſupplices literae venerunt à</hi>

For as our learned Proteſtant Antiquaries write: <hi>haec contigerunt anno à Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti aduentu in carne</hi> 179. <hi>vt veriores Annales commemorant:</hi> according to the trueſt accompt in Hiſtories this Ambaſſadge was in the 179. yeare of Chriſt, in which yeare by the common accompt, S. Soter was put to death, on the 22. day of Aprill, and the See Apoſtolike was voide before S. Eleutherius his Election 10. dayes. So the remnant of this yeare from the ſecond day of May is farre too short a time to aſſigne for the managing of ſo many and important affaires, eſpecially if we add the ſending hither againe, from Rome by Pope Eleutherius, <hi>Damianus</hi> and <hi>Fugatianus,</hi> which was alſo done in this yeare, as theſe men affirme: and much more if <hi>Eluanus</hi> and <hi>Meduuinus,</hi> which were but Catechumens and not Baptized when they were ſent from hence to Rome were ſo perfectly inſtructed, examined, and ordinarily as the courſe of the Roman Church was at that time proceeded in taking Eccleſiaſticall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Eluanus returning a Bishop, and Meduuinus a cheife Preacher and Preiſt, theſe things requiring a longer time then is allotted before to be done in the Papacie of Eleutherius, if they returned hither this yeare with <hi>S.

                     <hi>in eadem fide, ſub Eleutherio tunc Romano Pontifice inaugurari: When King Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius knew that very many noble Romans had receaued the faith of Christ from the Pope of Rome, and by their example the Chriſtian name was diſperſed and ſowen into all Prouinces, he appointed to be inaugured in the ſame faith by Eleutberius then Pope of Rome.</hi> Where we ſee it iuſtified by the firſt Proteſtant Archbishop that euer was, whome the reſt of our English Proteſtants doe willingly followe, that not onely the Nobles of the Romans had receaued the faith of Chriſt from the Pope of Rome, but all Prouinces had followed their example therein: Whereby it is euident both that there were many learned Bishops and Clergie men betweene this and Rome, of whome King Lucius with farre leſſe labour and difficulties might haue receaued the faith of Chriſt, then from the Pope of Rome, had not the Preeminency of that Apoſtolike See in ſuch, caſes called vpon him to appeale thither, for the generall and Iuridicall ſetling of himſelfe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7552:142"/> and kingdome in the Chriſtian faith. And by this narration itſelfe, without further Authoritie in this place, it is manifeſt, that if King Lucius had not vſed the Roman Popes power, and direction herein, he had bene ſingular, hauing no example to warrant him, but the example of all Prouinces <hi>ſingulas Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> in this part of the world, receauing the faith from the Pope of Rome to condemne him, euen in the Iudgment of Proteſtants themſelues, if he had otherwiſe proceeded in this buſines.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Therefore I can but maruayle what a Proteſtant Bishop meaneth, firſt to extoll with greate praiſe our King Lucius for this Action: and after aſmuch condemne him in the ſame reſpect.

                  <p n="6">6.

Of which age in this Country I dare not take vpon mee to finde Diſciples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Onely I graunt, (as I haue done before) that by the greate prouidence of God, one of this Nation and S. Peters Diſciple S. Manſuetus, was probably then liuing, but he was but one, and liued moſt at Tullum or Treuers, where he was Bishop farre from Glaſtenbury or any part of Britaine.</p>

And if there had bene any probable Authoritie that theſe men had bene borne in that part, I would haue thought my phraſe harsh in Hiſtory, if I had termed the one of them an <hi>Aualonian,</hi> and the other a <hi>Belgian,</hi> for the Ile of <hi>Aualon,</hi> is hard by <hi>welles, Glaſtenbury</hi> itſelfe but three English miles from <hi>welles,</hi> and part of <hi>Belgia,</hi> aſwell as <hi>welles</hi> and ſo euery <hi>Aualonian</hi> was a <hi>Belgian,</hi> and a <hi>Belgian</hi> borne about <hi>welles, in ea circa welliam parte,</hi> was not vnproperly an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualonian,</hi> the Ile of <hi>Aualon</hi> there circuiting about it; &amp; no Chriſtian was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in that part of the Country but in <hi>Aualonia,</hi> the onely Reſidency of S.

                  <p>Therefore theſe Latine ſonges being ſent from Rome to our Brittans heare, as theſe Proteſtants write to be ſunge &amp; heard, both the ſingers and heares of them muſt needs be ſaid to haue vnderſtood that languadge of the Romans in which they were penned by the Poet. So we need not ſeeke any further for Auditours to vnderſtand the preaching of theſe Roman Legats, though in the Latine tongue, when we haue founde allready the King himſelfe, all his Nobles and officers in Authoritie, and hauing command, all Schollars in our Vniuerſities, or Schooles, beſides others by probable Iudgment without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which vnderſtood them preaching, perſuading, reaſoning, diſputing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing or catechizing in that ſpeach.

And to giue more life to this opinion, when the Saxons became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and had Bishops, it was the care of the Popes and ſpirituall Rulers then to place both Arcbishops and Bishops where ſuch had bene in the Britans time. The two Archbishops Sees of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> which were voide, were by S. Gregory appointed for ſuch againe; and by this Title diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed Cities, as I shall more expreſſe hereafter, had alſo Bishops, being Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Sees when the Britans and Romans heare ruled.

                  <p n="7">7.

And by this we may be bold to ſeeke and ſetle a Bishops See euen in thoſe parts, which were after termed Scotland, hauing allowance from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie ſo to doe.

                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. And yet I grante what Hector Boethius writeth from the Scottish An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, <note place="margin">Hector Boeth. Scot.

                  <p n="4">4. And to teſtifie to poſteritie the Religion and deuotion that holy time had to their Saints, and ſacred Reliks, there is a greate long Chapter in the Manuſcript Antiquities of Glaſtenbury, there ſtiled and intituled: <hi>De Dignitate &amp; Sanctitate vetuſtae Eccleſiae Beate Mariae Glastoniae, ac eiuſde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſancti Caemiterij: of the dignitie, and ſanctitie of the old Church of bleſſed Mary at Glaſtenbury, and the holy Churchyard of the ſame.</hi> Where it is thus among other notable things regiſtred: <hi>In that Church, and Churchyard, and the Chappell in that Churchyard, are reſerued the holy bodies of many Saints: The conpaſſe about that Church: The pauement, the Altars vnder, aboue and within, are ſo heaped with holy Reliks thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged together, that in all that Churchyard</hi> 16. <hi>foote deepe from the topp, there is no place, that is without the bodies of Saints: In ea autem, &amp; in caemiterio, &amp; in eiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem caemiterij capella multorum Sanctorum corporales ſeruantur exuuiae adeo à bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum reliquijs illius fani ambitus, adeo pauimentum lapide conſtratum, adeo altaria, ſub, ſupra, &amp; infra, Reliquijs confertiſsimis aggeruntur, nec in toto illo caemiterio à profunditate</hi> 16. <hi>pedum vſque ad eius ſuperficiem à Sanctorum cineribus habetur lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus vacuus: Our holy Aunceſtours had that place in ſo greate reuerence, that they durſt not ſpeake in it, or ſpitt vpon the earth, except vpon greate neceſstie, and then with greate ſorrowe of hart. They durſt not bury any enemy of this Church, nor enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meous ſinner ſo much as they could learne in that holy Churchyarde, for the horrible voices which were often heard of them, vntill they were digged vp, and caſt out of the Churchyard. And many of the Monkes for reuerence to this holy place, by the iuſt Iudgment of God loſt their buriall there. No man brought hawke or dogge thither, which eſcaped vnpunished. That place was aunciently reuerenced with ſo greate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, that Kings, Queens, Archbishops, Bishops, Dukes, Knights, and Nobles of both Sexes, of whatſoeuer Order, of whatſoeuer dignitie they were, did thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues happy, which had endowed that place with any poſſeſsions, or might be buried there, or in other place with any part of this holy earth. And it was in ſuch reuerence, that they which were in health, and dwelled in other Nations beyond the ſeas, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them did often ſend for litle parcels of this holy earth, and keepe it moſt deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely for their burials. And often ſay to our English Pilgrims in thoſe parts, that if they knew the worthines and holines of this holy Churchyard, they would not ſeeke ſo many Pilgrimadges beyond the ſeas. There be three cauſes eſpecially, why that holy earth is with ſo greate greedines deſired for the buriall of Chriſtians. The firſt cauſe is, in reſpect our Lord with his preſence did dedicate it for the buriall of his ſeruants. The ſecond becauſe it is thought that greate remiſsion of ſins, is granted by our Lord by the prayers and merits of the Saints buried there, to ſuch as be buried in that place, or other with any parte of this holy earth.

And after King Lucius was conuerted, they had nothing, but the Almes of Chriſtians, and their owne paines and Induſtrie to ſuſtaine them, and yet theſe not at their owne, but Abbots diſpoſition. The holy place wherein they liued being left ſo long, and ſtrangely deſolate without man, woman, or childe, after the death of S.

                  <p n="2">2. If we will follow the more common opinion of Antiquaries, that the Miraculous man S.

In the firſt part of the night, he ſunge an hundred pſalmes, and bowed his knees two hundred times, and from the crowing of the cocke he ſtood in the water vntill he had ended his prayers, after this he ſlept vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a bare ſtone, and layed an other vnder his heade, and he had about his loines a leather coate dipped in water.</hi> And if we should queſtion S.

And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus who cauſed the <hi>wall</hi> of ſeperation to be made or finished, and defended, comming hither after the death of King Lucius, when this change of Temples into Epiſcopall Sees was generally made and confirmed, this Temporall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration could not in any reſpect hinder the extenſion, and practiſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power, and Iuriſdiction, at that ſetling and eſtablishing it heare gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in Britaine. And the Scottish Hiſtorians themſelues, when they come to make Relation of their Conuerſion in the time of Pope Victor, after S. Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius time, and after the Brittans, and Britaine had generally receaued the faith of Chriſt, and all Eccleſiaſticall matters heare eſtablished, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, that any one Bishop was ſent vnto them by Pope Victor, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Countrarye, when it is hard to finde in Antiquities how any
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7552:185"/> greate, and temporally independing people, or Nation, ſuch as the Scots then clay me to haue bene, except they were ſubiected to other Bishops, to rule and gouerne them in ſpirituall affaires, which is properly belonging to that highe ſpirituall dignitie, were conuerted without a Bishop, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And when S. Victor Pope ſent Preachers vnto them, they doe ſay, that he ſent them vnto them in, and throughout <hi>Albania,</hi> as if they, and not the Brittans had then poſſeſſed, and inhabited there: but they ſay, the <hi>Scots</hi> were then taught and inſtructed by Preiſts, which Pope Victor ſent to <note place="margin">Veremund. &amp; Hect.

                  <p n="3">3. The place and manner of his death is more queſtioned: diuers forreyne writers contend, that he forſooke his kingdome, and being made a Preiſt, and afterward Bishop, preached to the Rhetians in Germany, was Bishop there of Curre, and died by Martyrdome. The Roman Martyrologe inclineth to this opinion, making his death to haue bene <hi>Curiae in Germania:</hi> At Curre in Germanie, ſaying plainely as I haue cited before, that this Lucius which died there, <hi>was the firſt of the Kings of the Britans which receaued the faith of Chriſt in the time of Pope Eleutherius.</hi> This is the greateſt Authoritie I finde for this opinion, yet this Authour doth not take vpon him to ſay, that he was eyther Bishop, or Martyr, which he would not, neyther by his Order and rule of writing, which might not omit ſuch things, could haue omitted, if he had knowne or probably thought eyther of them to haue bene true.

And I haue giuen ſufficient warrant before, that for the faith and Religion of King Lucius in particular, it was Chriſtian, before the Papacy of S.

Beſides they ſay, that S. Emerita his Siſter went with him, and was Martyred there alſo. But it is euident by our Hiſtories, that our firſt Chriſtian King Lucius had neyther Brother, Siſter, nor childe, but he was <hi>vnicus patris,</hi> and begotten of King Coillus in his old Age, hauing no other childe, <hi>Anno gratiae</hi> 115. <hi>natus eſt Coillo, Regi Britonum, vnicus filius,</hi>

We reade in Hiſtories that many deſcended of Regall Race, haue in ſuch caſes bene taken forth of their Monaſteries, and Religeous Conuerſation, to gouerne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, deſtitute of heires, but that a King ſo vertuous, wiſe, louing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of his Country hauing no ſuch heire to ſucceede him, but by ſuch courſe to expoſe and leaue his kingdome to ſo many certaine miſeries, &amp; calamities, as fell vpon Britaine by the death of King Lucius, and probably were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene of all wiſe men, did, might, would, or could take ſuch a courſe, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities haue no example, iuſtice denieth it, charitie cannot allowe it. Further I shall proue hereafter that S. Emerita called the Siſter of S. Lucius, was the Siſter of Lucius Sonne of Conſtantius, and Helena, and ſo neyther daughter of King Coillus, nor Siſter to our firſt Chriſtian King Lucius, and ſo he could not be that Lucius which preached in Germany. <note place="margin">Aegid.

Who when Maſſe was ended, gaue vnto him a Paſtor all ſtaffe which he held in his hand, ſaying, take the rodd with which thow shall Rule the people of the Citie of Rhoan in the borders of Neuſtria. For there a place is prepared for thee by God: and allthough the Labour of the vnknowne life be burdenſome vnto thee, yet be not a fraide, becauſe our Lord Ieſus Christ will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee vnder the shadowe of his wings.

Which is further proued by that which followeth in the ſame Authours, what an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall care the Abbot of that place had of this Noble glorious Saint yet a child: <hi>Abbas illius loci:</hi> ſufficiently prouing there were then other Abbots of other Abbayes in that Country. There, alſo mention is made of the Church, Nunnery, Altar, and Abbeſſe of Anbesbury, whether the Reliks of that holy Saint were brought, after they had bene honorably buryed by the Bishops and Preiſts: <hi>ſepulto ab Epiſcopis &amp; Clericis capite cum Sacro corpore.</hi> That theſe Bishops, Preiſts, Monaſteryes, and Religious men and women of Britaine were in this time, I am vrged to thinke, becauſe theſe Hiſtorians haue told vs before that theſe things were in the beginning of Chriſtianitie heare, and add, that then many beleeued, and following the Apoſtles Precepts, were famous for Miracles, and that S. Melorus was one of that number <hi>Multi Domino cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, &amp; Apoſtolica praecepta ſequentes varijs virtutum Miraculis fulſerunt de quorum numero beatum Melorum fidenter credimus extitiſſe.</hi> Which is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the ſame Antiquities, teſtifying that after many yeares the Reliks of this holy Saint were with greate reuerence tranſlated to the Church of Amſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and there in their shryne layed vpon the Altar. <hi>Poſt multorum annorum curricula Praedicatores Alienigenae ſcrinium cum Reliquijs ſancti Melori circumqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que deferentes peragratis terrarum tractibus iniunctum ſibi officium exercentes Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brisburiam tandem deuenerunt, &amp; ſuper altare Reliquias ſanctas poſuerunt.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of theſe Reliks to the Church and Nunnery of Amsbury muſt needs be before the preuayling of the Pagan Saxons, and Hengiſt his murthering our Noble Britans, and taking King Vortiger Priſoner hard by that place, at Stonehendge by Treachery. For at that time, both that and all other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houſes, and Churches, thoſe Pagans could enter to, were deſtroyed. Yet the Hiſtoryes haue told vs before, that many yeares were paſſed ouer, betweene the buriall and remouing theſe holy Reliks thither. Neither dare I affirme, that this Hiſtory is more auncient then this time. For excepting the Religious houſe of Glaſtenbury, all others had their Foundation after the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of King Lucius, who dyed in the beginning of this Age. And probably we may coniecture, this Tranſlation of theſe ſacred Reliks was in the time of S. Germanus and Lupus the Legats of Pope Celeſtine, being and preaching heare, for they were <hi>praedicatores Alienigenae: Strange Preachers,</hi> and the moſt renowned ſtrange Preachers we can thinke theſe to be, much deuoted to the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our holy Brittish Reliks by all Hiſtoryes making ſolemne Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madges vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if we affirme, theſe holy Reliks were firſt interred in theſe dayes, the circuite of many yeares, <hi>post multorum annorum curricula,</hi> after which they were remoued by ſtrange Preachers, will well agree with the comming of thoſe ſtrangers, the Popes Legats hither about the yeare of Chriſt 432. which was before the Nunnery of Amsbury was deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Hiſtorie of this holy Saint is thus ſett downe by the auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">S.

This Rinoldus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus killed the Father, &amp; knowing his Sonne to be the onely true Heire, and fearing if he should liue to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eſtate he might take the Dukedome from

The other cheifeſt Proteſtant Antiquary writeth in this manner euen in his laſt Edition. <hi>Conſtantius what time he ſerued in Britaine vnder Aurelian, tooke to wife the daughter of Caelus, or Caelius a Brittish Prince, on whome he begatt that Noble Constantine the Greate in Britaine.

For by that accompt, as of Matthew Weſtminſter, Conſtantine was but an Infant 5. yeares olde, when after Conſtantius his Fathers death he was both King of Britaine, and Emperour.

                  <p>Neyther may we with prudence conceaue, that King Coel at her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riadge with Conſtantius, hauing poſſeſſion of, or Title vnto Britaine, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kingdome, nor the Religeous Chriſtian Archbishops, Prelates, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thereof, then at freedome in Religion, would haue condiſcended to ſuch a match, if neither Conſtantius nor she had bene a Chriſtian: that had not bene the way to procure to themſelues peace, and freedome which they ſought, but hazard of new trobles, Tumults and Perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hoped to auoide. Experience gaue a good Argument hereof to the Chriſtians of this Nation, for ſo long as this holy Lady and Queene was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to continue with her Husband, the State of Chriſtianitie was quiet heare, and the perſecuting Emperours Diocleſian and Maximian could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe nothing againſt it in this kingdome, but when they had forced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius to forſake her, and take a Pagan in her place, she herſelfe was perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, her Chriſtian children bannished, and that generall affliction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Religion enſued in this Nation, that no ſemblance of the like is left in Hiſtories to Poſteritie.

And Conſtantius was not at this time in Britaine, but came hither the ſecond time, diuers yeares after by our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and after the beginning of Diocleſian and Maximian their Perſecution heare.

And in the next immediate yeare 298. before Conſtantius could be tranſported into Britaine, they confeſſe, that Perſecution was dilated into all the Roman Empire. <hi>Anno Chriſti ducentiſsimo nonageſimo octauo Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe and ſuch Arguments and Authorities doe inuincibly proue vnto vs, that this Perſecution againſt the Chriſtians in Britaine was rayſed, and by publick Edicts, and Authoritie, or power of the Tyrant Maximian moſt barbarouſly proſecuted ſome yeares before the Martyrdome of S.

I haue proued before we had diuers Martyrs before this Age, and in this Perſecution we did not want thoſe that ſuffered Martyrdome before him: yet if we ſpeake of prioritie in time of Martyrs, whoſe names are kept in Hiſtories, this alſo is his owne in that ſence in this Perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for he is particularly the firſt that is regiſtred by name in our Annals, to haue ſuffered Martyrdome in this time.

And hauing done all things which mans crueltie could worke againſt him, they began to mocke him with words, ſaying vnto him. Haile King of the Iewes, if thou art the ſonne of God now come downe from thy Croſſe, and we beleeue thee and when they vſed many reuilings againſt him, that younge man anſweared not one word vnto them.

The things which thow relateſt of Chriſt are true, and cannot in any respect he reproued as falſe, for I this night haue euidently knowne, how Chriſt ouercame the deuill, bounde him, and thruſt him downe to the botome of Hell: I haue ſeene with my eyes, how that Horrible one lyeth bewrapped in the knots of chaines, hereby knowing that all things thow hast ſpoken are true.

O Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſuffer not the malice of the deuill ſo much to preuaile, that by his crafty deuiſes, and aſſent of this people, he may hinder my paſsion. And turning himſelfe to the people, ſaid vnto them: Why doe you ſtay? If you know not to giue ſentence take Counſaile of your Lawes; examine the ſtatuts of your Citie, they will inſinuate vnto you, what you ought to doe. Why doe you make delay? Be it knowne to you all, that I am a greate Enemy of your Gods. For how can they be worthie any honour, which are knowne to haue no diuine thing in them, being the Works of mens hands? You yourſelues are their witneſſes, that they ſee nothing heare nothing, vnderſtand nothing. O greately to be deteſted vanity, to hope for life of them, that neuer liued, to pray vnto them, wbich neuer heard, to ſeeke health of things, that neuer were well themſelues. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon I abſolutely pronounce, that he which worshippeth ſuch is moſt madde.

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW to calme theſe tempeſts of troubles, I ſuppoſe (by our beſt Hiſtories) that this Perſecution of Diocleſian, and Maximian heare raged about the ſpace of 9. or 10. yeares in the time of Aſclepiodotus principally, and that now at the Martyrdome of S. Amphibalus, ſo greate miſeries and afflictions had bene layed vpon our holy Chriſtians heare long time, as their flying from hence vnto other Nations, their aboade there, returne hither againe, and heare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing no short ſpace, before they were putt to death, as is manifeſt in the caſe of S. Amphibalus, not martyred vntill allmoſt a yeare after S. Alban, who was kept in priſon 6. moneths before his Martyrdome, that now thowſands were conuerted to Chriſt, and the cheife Municipall Cities themſelues, where Idolatry ſo reigned, that a Chriſtian was rare to be then founde in them as in Verolam, were now onely inhabited by Chriſtians, <hi>fidem Chriſti tota ciuitas deuotè ſuſcepit,</hi> and not a Pagan to be ſeene, and this by the omnipotent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God. And the Idolatrous Iudge or Prince himſelfe, that ruled heare vnder the Pagan Romans, and perſecuted by their Power euen to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bounds of Britaine, was madd <hi>amens effectus,</hi> that he was vnable to Rule, and gouerne any longer, but needed to be ruled and gouerned himſelfe by others. And yet as is manifeſt before, by his Perſecutions in all places of Britaine, in ſuch powerfull and tumultuous manner, with greate troopes, and military companies of his perſecuting vaſſals, and Inſtruments, which none but a Roman Lieutenant, or King heare then could raiſe and commande. This Iudge, King and Roman Lieutenant, as the Scottish Hiſtorians with others call him, was King Aſclepiodotus, thus greeuiouſly eyther of malice or for feare of the Romans then perſecuting, &amp; for ſo doing hated of God and man.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. And diuers euen of this Nation haue before deliuered, that this our now King and Emperour did particularly place S.

For this, we haue the warrant of our moſt auntient and approued Antiquaries S. Gildas, and S. Bede, and after them Matthew of Weſtminſter with others. S. Gildas writeth, <hi>that before the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution had bene heare ten yeares, the wicked Decrees againſt Chriſtians were annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and fruſtrate, and all the ſeruants of Christ, as after a longe winter night with</hi>

And as Regino writeth, not onely in Britaine, but generally where he ruled, both Bishops were reſtored to their priuate Sees, and many other things graunted for the profit of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: <hi>Constantij Temporibus pace Eccleſijs reddita, Epiſcopi priuatis ſedibus resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuuntur, &amp; alia plura Christianae Religioni profutura.</hi> And particularly ſaith, that the Monaſtery of Treuers was begun in his time. Then much more in Britaine, where he was both abſolute Emperour and King to commande, and no man daring to reſiſt him. To this our Proteſtant Antiquaries haue giuen ſufficient allowance, when they graunted vnto vs, that Conſtantius <hi>abolished the ſuperſtition of the Gentils in his Dominions,</hi> eſpecially in Britaine, where he now liued King and Emperor, and ſo in abolishing the Pagans Rites, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruances
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:7552:250"/> for diſlike of them, and loue to Chriſtian Religion, muſt needs for his short time be an extraordinary Aduancer thereof. But when he had thus <note place="margin">The death of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: &amp; his great loue then of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and that Religion.</note> happily begun this holy worke in reparing the ruines of the Church of Chriſt in this kingdome, and before he could bring it to due, and his deſired perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he fell ſick at the Citie of Yorke, where ſoone after he deceaſed. Yet in this short time of his ſicknes, his greateſt care was to leaue and commit this his charge both concerning his Empire, and this kingdome to his eldeſt ſonne Conſtantine now liuing, ſonne of S.

And it can haue no other conſtruction to be true: for euident it is in Hiſtories that not onely from the beginning of the Reigne of Conſtantine, but in his Fathers time, all Chriſtians vnder their gouernment were free from Perſecution: And ſo ſoone as Conſtantine had conquered Maxentius and was ſole and abſolute Emperour, all Chriſtians in the world vnder him were deliuered from Perſecution, and ſett at libertie euen publickly to profeſſe their Religion. And from his firſt entrance into the Empire and to be King of Britaine, the Chriſtians heare in this Nation did not onely enioy freedome and Immunitie from all penalties, and Perſecution againſt Chriſtian <note place="margin">Churches and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries that were ruinated, reſtored, and new builded.</note> Religion, but, as in the time of his Father, made, and freely had publike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Profeſſion thereof, as our old Churches reedified, new builded and erected, Bishops, Preiſts, and all Cleargie and Religious men reſtored to their former quiet, Reuenewes, honours and dignities.</p>

The</hi> 15. <hi>day of March following, it was againe hallowed and dedicated vnto the honor and memory of Amphibalus, that had ſuffered death for Chriſt in the late Perſecution, by Conſtans Bishop of Wincheſter, at te requeſt of Deodatus Abbot of this new erected Monaſtery.</hi> It is euident by this Relation, and that is ſaide before, that this holy worke ſo publike and with freedome and zeale was quite finished in the time of Conſtantine his being heare before he went hence againſt Maxentius.

The Church with vnſpeakable deuotion builded, and dedicated to that holy Saint and Martyr, which in the late Perſecution was moſt hated by the enemies of Chriſt. So I ſay of the Church of S.

Sylueſter Pope of Rome, and in that his then Imperiall Citie, of which I shall more plainely entreate hereafter. Among their Arguments beſides Authours of all kindes, Greekes and Latins Pagans, and Chriſtians with other inuincible teſtimonies, a reaſon of cheife importance is, that ſo Religious and verruous a Prince and Benefactor, of the Church of Chriſt by Religion would not, and in conſcience could not ſo long hazard his ſaluation, by deferring his Baptiſme, the dore to enter into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. The ſame Argument by proportion I may vſe againſt Baronius, and all thoſe, that delay the Baptiſme of this renowned Emperour vntill the 324. yeare of Chriſt, when he had bene Emperour allmoſt 20. yeares before, and ſo long, and more a Chriſtian in Iudgment and affection at the leaſt, as I haue inuincibly proued. He that had ſought by ſo many, and chardgeable meanes, to take away, preuent, and hinder negligences and ſins in other Chriſtians, in all places of his Dominions, may not be thought ſo negligent, and forgetfull of his owne good, and happines eternall, ſo many yeares in ſo many dangers as he vnderwent to play his ſoule at hazard, and tempt God ſo long and often in ſo high a degree.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And theſe Authours Themſelues ſet downe many Chriſtian Acts and <note place="margin">Baron. &amp; Spond. in Annal. an. 313. 314. 315. 316. 317. 318. 319.</note> profeſſions of Conſtantine which free him from ſuch neglect. In the next yeare to his Victorie againſt Maxentius, being the yeare of Chriſt 313. he gaue his ſiſter Conſtantia a Chriſtian, as theſe men ſay, wife to Licinius, not then probable that he could be ſo mindfull of his Siſters ſpirituall good; and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of his owne, when eſpecially, as all Hiſtories teſtifie, he made this match for the propagation of Chriſtian Religion, Licinus by this meanes Ioyening with him in this buſines, by his procureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. He giueth the greateſt reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; higheſt honour to the Decrees &amp; Sentence of Bishops, gaue his Palace La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane to Pope Melchiades in Rome, and Reuenewes to all other Bishops in the tenth yeare of his Empire, he celebrated the Feaſt and ſolemnitie thereof <hi>Chriſtiano ritu,</hi> as a Chriſtian should, and reiecteth the wonted Pagan exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. He granteth great libertie to all Bishops. Warreth againſt Licinius, for defence of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>pro defenſione Religionis Chriſtianae.</hi> He was the onely Emperour, none to reſiſt him in the yeare of Chriſt 319. and then euery where he gaue peace to the Church of Chriſt, <hi>pace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eccleſiae vbique reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit,</hi> abolishing the Witches and Southſayers of the Pagans. All theſe beſides other Chriſtian workes and Acts, Baronius confeſſeth Conſtantine publikly performed 5. or 6. yeares before the Nicen Councell. How then can he proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly teach, that he was batized the yeare before. He confeſſeth there were by his procurement 600. Bishops at the Councell of Arles in the yeare 314. in the yeare 325. 318. Bishops at Nyce in Bithinia, and 377. at Rome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Conſtantine cheife Agent to abolish the Pagan Flamens, to whome theſe Bishops ſucceeded had not bene a Chriſtian much longer, how could ſo many Bishops be ſo ſoone aſſembled together, or haue bene in the whole worlde. The very ſummoning and aſſembling them from ſo many, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and ſeparated Nations into two places, muſt needs demande a farre longer warning. Againe it is euident both by Greeke and Latine Authours, that Conſtantine was in the Eaſt, and not at Rome, where he was baptized, when the Nicen Councell was kept, and at the Citie of Nice before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were aſſembled there. So many Diſputs both with Arrians and Pagan Philoſophers as were had in that Councell, ſo many matters there handled
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:7552:263"/> and concluded, and Canons by all Regiſters and Authours decreed in ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike affaires of ſo greate conſequence, in the whole Church of Chriſt, after ſo long and difficult iornies before they could be aſſembled, and many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate differences &amp; contentions firſt ended, before matters of faith were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſufficiently warrant vs by example of all other Councells, that this ſo generall, and firſt of that nature that euer was, muſt needs be of a longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance anſweareable to the difficulties thereof, and ſo this Councell ending in the 325. yeare of Chriſt, &amp; Conſtantine baptized before the calling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he muſt needs be baptized long ſooner then the 324. yeare of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I add further, that it is euident both by Euſebius, Socrates, Sozomen, and others auncient, and by Baronius and Spondanus themſelues, that the yeare of diſſoluing and ending the Nicen Councell did occurre with the 20. yeare <note place="margin">Euſebius l. 3. de Vita Conſtant. cap. 14. 15. l. 4. c. 40. 47.

So doth the old Roman Marty raloge and Menologion of the Greekes alſo. And Baronius himſelfe confeſſeth that in this his very ſeuenth yeare Conſtantine ſet forth many Edicts both for the reſtoring the goods of Chriſtians, Priuiledges, and Immunities of their Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as alſo to releeue the Chriſtians that had bene perſecuted out of his owne Treaſure; And the next yeare after, he gaue to Pope Melchiades immediate Predeceſſor to S.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:7552:264"/> Phrigia.

                  <p n="2">2.

Or how could ſuch a man as this Octauius is ſuppoſed to be, aſſemble ſuch an Army in Britaine, where that moſt victorious Emperour was vndoubted King, and whence he had ſo greate an Army of Britons ſo lately before, that by them, as our Hiſtorians write, he vanquished allmoſt inmunerable Companies of his moſt potent Enemy, <hi>Magnam manum Britonum abduxit, per quorum induſtriam,</hi>

This affirmation that all the Bishops of Britaine excepting onely three which were poore, &amp; were profered to be maintained by their fellow Bishops which were generally ritch as I haue declared before in the Foundation of King Lucius giuing them both all the Flamens and Archflamens Lands &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenewes.

And if thoſe few poore Bishops of Britaine which were not able to beare their owne charges, were drawne thither to be maintained by the Emperour, how much rather muſt we iudge the ſame of ſo many potent and ritch in this Country which could pretend no ſuch excuſe.

And Alipius was gone hence, neuer medling in matters of Religion, heare in Britayne, for any thing we finde in Hiſtorie, and come to Antioch in the Eaſt before Iulian began his Perſecution againſt Chriſtians, and from them was ſent by Iulian to Hieruſalem, to help the Iewes to build againe their Temple there, which God did ſo miraculouſly preuent, and hinder, as all Hiſtories agree. <note place="margin">Storre ſupr.</note> One of theſe Authors ſaith: <hi>Iulian ſent Alipius who had bene a Lieutenant of Britaine to repayre Hieruſalem.</hi> Others write: <hi>to repayre theſe curſed Walles,</hi>

                  <head>THE XXIII. CHAPTER.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>OF DIVERS RENOWNED SAINTS HEARE in Britayne in this time, S. Kebius a glorious Catholicke Bishop, a greate and long acquaintance of S. Hilary of France, S. Decumanus and others.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY were our renowned and holy Bishops in this time, as I haue before remembred, allthough in generall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, not mentioning their names, which continued firme and conſtant in the Catholike faith, ioyning with the Popes of Rome, S. Athanaſius, S. Hilary, and the reſt, which confuted and condemned the Arrian Hereſie. Among theſe S. Kebius was one, ſonne of Salomon Duke of Cornwayle, who continued heare in Britayne vntill he was about 29. yeares of Age, profiting much and proceeding in learning: then hearing of the fame of S. Hilary, went ouer into France, and ioyned himſelfe vnto him, then renowned for Sanctitie, and holy learning. This was the motiue which drew him thither, and from his Country, and not to auoyde the venime of Arrianiſme then ariſing and breeding in this Country, as a late Writer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectureth <note place="margin">Io. Pitſeus l. de Illuſtr. Britan. Script. aetat. 6. in Kebio Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio.</note> rather, then proueth, or can be proued: <hi>propter tum pullulantem in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia Arrianam Haereſim, adhuc inuenis in Galliam ſeceſsit.</hi> For I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore freed Britayne from any ſuch dangerous infection, and rather France then Britayne was ſubiect to ſuch danger. And at the time when S. Kebius went into France, the Arrian Hereſie was not yet ryſen either in Britayne, or any part of the world in probable Iudgment. For both by this Writer, and <note place="margin">Io. Pitſ. ſupr. Magdebur. cent. 4. cap. 10. Harr. Hiſt. Tom. 4. cap. 32. Io. Lela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. &amp; alij.</note> others both auncient and late, S. Kebius dyed in the yeare of Chriſt 380. an old man, <hi>in ſenectute bona, operibus bonis plenus,</hi> one ſaith, diuers yeares ſooner, in the yeare 368. And yet the old Manuſcript of his life, Capgraue &amp; others affirme, that he conuerſed with S. Hilary 50. yeares, <hi>tranſito mari apud Hilarium Picta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenſem Epiſcopum per quinquaginta annos manens.</hi> Therefore S. Hilary dying in the yeare of Chriſt 369. as is proued before, and S. Kebius lyuing with him 50. yeares, he muſt needs be gone out of Britayne before the Nicen Councell, <note place="margin">Manuſcr. Antiq. de vit. S. Kebij. Capgrau. Catal. in eodem.</note> and Arrian Hereſie, allthough he had continued with S. Hilary vnto his death, which no Writer affirmeth, but the contrary. And his lyuing Bishop in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne after his returne hither many yeares euidently ſo conuinceth. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doth the bannishment of S. Hilary into Phrygia, many yeares before he dyed, by which argument we muſt needs hold, that eyther S. Kebius of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne was bannished with him, or followed him in that exile, for which we haue neyther Authoritie, nor warrant of reaſon; or ſay, that S. Kebius was conſecrated Bishop by S. Hilary before his exilement by Conſtantius, and then returned into Britayne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And yet it is as vnprobable in my opinion, which the ſame Author ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to hold, that this Kebius then a Bishop was at that Councell of Arles in France, wherein S. Reſtitutus our Archbishop of London ſubſcribed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:7552:302"/> his going thither from Britayne was one of them which reſiſted Pelagius his Hereſy heare, <hi>Britones Pelagium in Exilium eiecerunt, eiuſque doctrinae inter</hi>

                     <hi>alios reſtiterunt Reſtitutus Archiepiſcopus Londinenſis, &amp; Kebius Corinius Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Mannenſis. Qui quoniam in Britannia res turbatae fuerint in Galliam ad ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Hilarium Pictauienſem Epiſcopum: &amp; deinde ad Concilium Arelatenſe ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ſuper his, &amp; alijs fidei negotijs ſeſe contulerunt.</hi> For I haue proued before, that this Councell of Arles to which S. Reſtitutus ſubſcribed, was long before this time, and before S. Hilary himſelfe was eyther Bishop, Preiſt, or Clergie man, or of any fame in ſuch affayres. And this Author himſelfe ſetteth downe <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pitſ. aetat.</hi> 5. in Reſtituto.</note> the death of S. Reſtitutus in the yeare 350. before eyther S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hilary was Bishop, or Pelagius vented his Hereſie. Therefore I may chooſe the midle, as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way to walke in, for S. Kebius being made Bishop by S. Hilary, and his returne into Britayne to haue bene about the time of S. Hilary his Exile into Phrygria. For it is euident by S. Hilary himſelfe that it was long before he applyed himſelfe to the ſtudy of Diuinity, or probably was a Chriſtian; and by no Author was Bishop 20. yeares. And if we might write by coniecturs <note place="margin">Hilar. l. 1. de Trinitate. Baron. &amp; Spond. Annal. an. 355.</note> not wanting probabilitie, we should rather be of opinion, that this holy S. Kebius was one of our poore Brittish Bishops, ſpoken of before in generall termes, which were preſent at the Councell of Ariminum, then of Arles, the laſt without all probabilitie, but for congruently thinking him to haue bene preſent at Ariminum ſo generall an Aſſembly as is related, we haue the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time agreeing, that he was familiar with S. Hilary and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of France, that he was a Bishop of Britayne, and for his longe conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in forreyne Countries more fitt then others for that employment now, and further he was a poore Bishop, ſuch as Britayne had but few at that time, and yet S. Seuerus Sulpitius hath proued vnto vs, that Britayne had among the reſt, three poore Bishops there, <hi>Tres tantum ex Britannia, inopia proprij, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blico</hi>

Martine came firſt into France by Sulpitius Seuerus and other forreine Hiſtorians. And it further inuincibly proueth, that ſaint Ninian was in this Age many yeares brought vp at Rome, made Bishop there, and by the Pope ſent Apoſtle vnto the Picts, longe time ſooner, then the common opinion of Antiquaries aſſigneth to his comming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Therefore I may boldly with the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Hiſtories accompt him among the holy and learned Fathers of this Age, whereof he ſpent a greate parte in moſt holy and auſteare conuerſation of life, preaching the Ghoſpell of Chriſt, and conuerting Infidels to his true Religion, allthough lyuing longe as the Secretaryes of this greate Saint ſay, he ſuruiued vntill the next Age, where I shall more remember him.

At the time of the firſt accompt, the Scots were not in this kingdome, as I haue made manifeſt before, and before Hildebertus could be Tutor to Sedulius by either of the later reckonings, the Scots were probably driuen out of Britaine by
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:7552:314"/> Maximus, about the yeare 379. when Sedulius being long time Scholler to this Bishop, muſt needs be old in the 430. of Chriſt and much older, neare an hundred yeares old, if he liued vnto the yeare 460. yet he is not by any Writer noted for an old man. We cannot ſay, that this Hildebertus was Archbishop of the Scots in Ireland; for although diuers hold, that diuers of the Scotish Irish had receaued the faith of Chriſt before ſaint Palladius, or S.

Our English Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Writers of the greate Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Britaine, whome I dare not allowe, make him farre more auncient then this time. That which our Proteſtants haue before ſet downe of S. Patrike, <hi>that the babes yet vnborne ſeemed to him in his dreames from out of their Mothers wombes to call for Chriſtendome,</hi> is teſtified more plainely and credibly by olde and better Authours, that it was a true viſion, and calling of S. Patrike to be the Apoſtle of that Nation. In a viſion an Epiſtle was repreſented vnto him, and the beginning of it was, <hi>this is the voice of the people of Ireland, haec eſt vox Hibernenſium.</hi> And reading this beginning of that letter, at the ſame inſtant, and moment of time the voice of Infants from their Mothers wombs in diuers Contries of Irelande crying as it were with one mouth, <hi>ô holy Father we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, that thou wilt come and walke amonge vs. By which extraordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion S.

<pb n="602" facs="tcp:7552:320"/> thus it was in all places, and Prouinces of this Kingdome, where theſe Pagans raiged moſt, London, Wincheſter, Lincolne, Yorke and others Prouinces, <hi>quaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Prouincias,</hi> Where they deſtroyed Churches, and all holy Monuments, <note place="margin">Matth.

For as his Hereſies were moſt peſtilent, dangerous, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious, ſo they tooke firſt roote, and afterward fixed themſelues ſo deepely in this Britaine, that they were not rooted out, vntill after the comming of ſaint Auguſtine hither aboue 200. yeares after, notwithſtanding we had ſo many and worthie men heare both of our owne Nation, and others, diuers of them ſent hither by the Apoſtolike Roman See, Power, and Authoritie thereof, to oppoſe, and ſuppreſſe it, as both our Scottish and English Writers, Catholiks and Proteſtants doe teſtifie. It is the common conſent of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians both of this and forreyne Countries, that this Pelagius was a Britan of this kingdome. Diuers of our Antiquaries not onely Catholiks but Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants hold, that he was a Monke, and Abbot after in our old renowned Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of Bangot. Which is made more probable, both in reſpect that Lepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Agricola his Scholler and follower in his errors a long time, though after recanting them, was a Preiſt and Monke of the ſame Monaſtery: <hi>Factus eſt Sacerdos &amp; Monachus in celebri Banchorenſi Caenobio.</hi> And of all places in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the parts thereabouts were moſt infected with that Hereſie, raigning there long after the time of ſaint Germanus and Lupus ſent hither by Pope Celeſtine to ſuppreſſe it, &amp; was in a Sinod of all the Bishops, Abbots, &amp; cheife Clergy men of Cambria there confuted and confounded by ſaint Dauid. And as I haue mentioned before, diuers Clergy men in that Country were longe after ſaint Dauids death, in the time of King Frequahard of Scotland ſtill infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted therewith. All Authors agree this Pelagius was very learned, and the Title Archereticke, Hereſiarches, which is commonly giuen vnto him doth ſo teſtifie. So doth his diſperſing his Hereſies into ſo many learned Nations, <hi>venena ſuae perfidiae longe lateque diſperſit.</hi> So doe the greate number of Councels aſſembled in diuers places to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne him. So doe the particular beſt learned men in thoſe dayes, ſaint Auguſtine, ſaint Hierome, ſaint Innocentius, Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Gennadius and others which wrote againſt him. So doe they which write of learned Writers, both auncient and later Catholiks and Proteſtants, witneſſing that he wrote many and learned Catholike Bookes before he fell into Hereſie. By which we may gather, that this Nation in ſuch troble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tempeſteous times had Schooles to breede vp learned men, by whome ſo ſoone as Pelagius was fallen into Hereſie, and noted thereof
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:7552:323"/> he was bannished from hence, into forreine Countries, neuer returning hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe.
