            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as your LOVE hath beene GREAT to this mo≈øt honourable Earle, who was Di≈øcreet in his words, Prudent and iu≈øt in all his Actions, Charitable to the Poore, Affable to all, Faithfull to his Countrie, Gratious to his Soueraigne, Con≈øtant in his Faith and Religion, mo≈øt beloued and honoured of all; and then whome noe Noble man of England was more affected, or more Generally honoured in his life, or more Bewayled and lamented after his death; So your VERTVES doe shine in this world with a mo≈øt re≈øplendent LIGHT, and are the DIAMONDS and PEARLES which adorne the RING of your Auncient NOBILITIE.

<pb facs="tcp:7552:4"/> and Saxons did, thereby giuing and duely to this renowned, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt Iland, the name and Title of the mo≈øt Noble and Holy fir≈øt Chri≈øtian Kingdome in the world. To renewe and illu≈øtre who≈øe honor and glory, therein (lately too much by ≈øome ob≈øcured) and shew the way of truth to all that be now wandring in error, and want direction, to know the holy true Religion of tho≈øe happy times in this Nation, that if they will not be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully erring and ignorant, they may ea≈øely and plainely knowe it, and ≈øecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace and profe≈ø≈øe it, as their holy, and Religious Aunce≈øtors and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors did. This dutie hath cheefly called vpon me to write this Eccle≈øia≈øticall Hi≈øtory, of our Noble Britaine, deducing it from the Natiuitie of our ble≈ø≈øed Sauiour Chri≈øt Ie≈øus vntill the happy, full Conuer≈øion of our Aunce≈øtors the Saxons in the ≈øeuenth hundered yeare, after which time our Eccle≈øia≈øticall Hi≈øtories are plaine and perfect, not needing helpes, or Additions.</p>
            <p>And this which I haue taken in hand, e≈øpecially the fir≈øt 600. yeares, are the mo≈øt difficulte Worke Britaine had to be performed in this kynde, mo≈øt or many of the Antiquities and Monuments of tho≈øe times by many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of enemies to tho≈øe holy dayes, par≈øons, and proceedings, de≈øtroyed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed, concealed, ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, defaced, or abu≈øed, and tho≈øe that from many difficulties, and dangers be ≈øtill pre≈øerued, are not without greate fauour, labour, diligence and co≈øt to poore Students, e≈øpecially Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks to be obtained. Yet I a poore Catholike Student in holy learning from my young yeares, vnto my now old Age, may boldly confe≈ø≈øe, which this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory it≈øelfe will proue, that I haue ≈øeene, &amp; diligently peru≈øed the mo≈øt &amp; be≈øt Monuments, and Antiquities extant, or their true Copies, which I could learne of, know and procure, requi≈øite and v≈øefull for ≈øuch a Worke, and therefore at the entreaty and de≈øire of diuers my learned friends, hauing better opinion of my ≈øtudies and reading, then I dare affirme of my ≈øelfe, haue taken this greate charge in hand, and wholly performed and ended it, written in our English tongue, becau≈øe principally of England, and to English men.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7552:38"/> of the world was made, among them. For longe after that time writing to the Galathians, he ≈øaith: <hi>Neyther went I vp to Hieru≈øalem to them, which were A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Galat. cap. 1. v. 17. 18. 19.</note>

But other ef the Apostles ≈øawe I none, ≈øaue Iames the Lords Brother.</hi> Thus S. Paul, as our Prote≈øtants by our Kings allowance tran≈ølate him.

And except all men of learning, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants and others be deceaued, in teaching that S. Peter fir≈øt conuerted the Romans to the faith of Chri≈øt, S. Paul giueth to him, the honour of that Chri≈øtianitie which the Britans had: for writing to the Romans he ≈øaith, <hi>I</hi>

It was neyther S. Paul, nor S. Simon Zelotes, but S. Simon Peter, that eyther by him≈øelf or his holy Di≈øciples fir≈øt preached heare.

Thy people haue ≈øinned again≈øt God, and he hath giuen them ouer into the hands of Nations, and they which hated them haue ruled ouer them. But God will not forget to haue mercy, nor conteine his mi≈øerations in his angor. For it will come to pa≈ø≈øe, when thou shalt ≈øleepe with thy Fathers, our Lord will vi≈øit his people, and make redemption of his ≈øeruants.

And yet a Church ≈øo aunciently dedicated to him heare, would of it ≈øelfe by Brittish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in ≈øuch affaires, induce vs to thinke, that eyther he was a Britan borne, or preached in this our Britayne, or both. For in peru≈øing our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of tho≈øe times, we shall hardly finde any Church dedicated in this kingdome to any Saint, except the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin Mary, for her eminent priuiledge, but to ≈øuch as were Saints of this Nation, as S.

                  <p n="7">7. To make which more apparantly probable vnto vs, we haue two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned and annuncient Authors, Methodius and S.

                     <note place="margin">Arnold. Mitm. Theatr.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7552:65"/> opinion; for all Antiquities agree, that through out the whole kingdome in the time of King Lucius, all the Cathedrall and Epi≈øcopall Churches were in cyties. Which argueth this See to haue had a more auncient originall, then from that time: for further proofe whereof, the auncient Manu≈øcript Hi≈øtory <note place="margin">Hi≈øtor. Roffen. M.

And the Church of S. Peter in Cornhill being dedicated to him, and the Cathedrall Church, by all Antiquities, we cannot be of any other minde, but S.

For allthough at the time of ≈øaint Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie his beginning his Iorney from Britaine to Rome the Church of Chri≈øt was at ≈øome ea≈øe, and quiet, Antoninus Pius that friend to Chri≈øtians, yet continuing his Empire, or if Marcus Aurelius Antoninus the per≈øecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had begun his Empire, yet he had not begun his Per≈øecution at that time, or the knowledge thereof had not yet trauailed ≈øo farre as Britaine, to giue warning and notice to King Lucius, of any ≈øuch thinge, eyther acted or intended. But when he, and his new Chri≈øtian people heare had for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie learned what barbarous and cruell Per≈øecutions were now in hand, as all Antiquities of that time doe witnes, and to be ≈øilent in others, that our Noble Brittish Chri≈øtian hou≈øe in Rome, which had continued ≈øo long quiet, and bene ≈øuch a Seminary of Religion for this kingdome, was now ≈øo cruelly afflicted, 23. renowned Martyrs tyrannically and without all tryall putt to death in the place and hou≈øe it≈øelfe, as I haue related, and ≈øaint Iu≈øtine and his ≈øacred company after that, carryed al≈øo from thence to durance and Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ≈øaint Timothie our Apo≈øtle Countryman and owner of that holy hou≈øe together with ≈øaint Marke his happy companion in Martyrdome, and likely in his Trauailes in Britaine, were taken from that place to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Pope Pius al≈øo which much conuer≈øed there, and should haue bene a cheife meanes in directing and a≈ø≈øi≈øting our generall Conuer≈øion, if it had then taken effect putt to death by the≈øe Emperours for that cau≈øe.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. And allthough the Per≈øecution in Britaine by our Hi≈øtories began about that time Con≈øtantius was compelled to putt away S. Helen and take Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora, and was therevpon made a Cae≈øar: Yet he did not thereby receaue any Emperiall Power or Authoritie, more then he had before: for the name Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øar in ≈øuch ≈øence died with Nero, and was not renewed vntill the time of Adrian, who adopted Antoninus Pius for Cae≈øar, onely a name of honour and Titular to be Emperour, and not of pre≈øent Power and Authoritie, as it was in, and before the time of Nero. And Con≈øtantius was not at this time in Britaine, but came hither the ≈øecond time, diuers yeares after by our Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and after the beginning of Diocle≈øian and Maximian their Per≈øecution heare. And was one of the Con≈øuls at Rome after that taking of Theodora and Per≈øecution begun in Britaine: For as the≈øe Authours ≈øay, he was Con≈øul in the yeare of Chri≈øt 297. All which yeare he mu≈øt needs be at Rome, when the Roman Hi≈øtories them≈øelues confe≈ø≈øe the Per≈øecution of Diocle≈øian began long before. And in the next immediate yeare 298. before Con≈øtantius could be tran≈øported into Britaine, they confe≈ø≈øe, that Per≈øecution was dilated into all the Roman Empire. <hi>Anno Chri≈øti ducenti≈øsimo nonage≈øimo octauo Per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He that had ≈øought by ≈øo many, and chardgeable meanes, to take away, preuent, and hinder negligences and ≈øins in other Chri≈øtians, in all places of his Dominions, may not be thought ≈øo negligent, and forgetfull of his owne good, and happines eternall, ≈øo many yeares in ≈øo many dangers as he vnderwent to play his ≈øoule at hazard, and tempt God ≈øo long and often in ≈øo high a degree.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>OF DIVERS RENOWNED SAINTS HEARE in Britayne in this time, S. Kebius a glorious Catholicke Bishop, a greate and long acquaintance of S. Hilary of France, S. Decumanus and others.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY were our renowned and holy Bishops in this time, as I haue before remembred, allthough in generall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, not mentioning their names, which continued firme and con≈øtant in the Catholike faith, ioyning with the Popes of Rome, S. Athana≈øius, S. Hilary, and the re≈øt, which confuted and condemned the Arrian Here≈øie. Among the≈øe S. Kebius was one, ≈øonne of Salomon Duke of Cornwayle, who continued heare in Britayne vntill he was about 29. yeares of Age, profiting much and proceeding in learning: then hearing of the fame of S. Hilary, went ouer into France, and ioyned him≈øelfe vnto him, then renowned for Sanctitie, and holy learning. This was the motiue which drew him thither, and from his Country, and not to auoyde the venime of Arriani≈øme then ari≈øing and breeding in this Country, as a late Writer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectureth <note place="margin">Io. Pit≈øeus l. de Illu≈øtr. Britan. Script. aetat. 6. in Kebio Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio.</note> rather, then proueth, or can be proued: <hi>propter tum pullulantem in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia Arrianam Haere≈øim, adhuc inuenis in Galliam ≈øece≈øsit.</hi> For I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore freed Britayne from any ≈øuch dangerous infection, and rather France then Britayne was ≈øubiect to ≈øuch danger. And at the time when S. Kebius went into France, the Arrian Here≈øie was not yet ry≈øen either in Britayne, or any part of the world in probable Iudgment. For both by this Writer, and <note place="margin">Io. Pit≈ø. ≈øupr. Magdebur. cent. 4. cap. 10. Harr. Hi≈øt. Tom. 4. cap. 32. Io. Lela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d. &amp; alij.</note> others both auncient and late, S. Kebius dyed in the yeare of Chri≈øt 380. an old man, <hi>in ≈øenectute bona, operibus bonis plenus,</hi> one ≈øaith, diuers yeares ≈øooner, in the yeare 368. And yet the old Manu≈øcript of his life, Capgraue &amp; others affirme, that he conuer≈øed with S. Hilary 50. yeares, <hi>tran≈øito mari apud Hilarium Picta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen≈øem Epi≈øcopum per quinquaginta annos manens.</hi> Therefore S. Hilary dying in the yeare of Chri≈øt 369. as is proued before, and S. Kebius lyuing with him 50. yeares, he mu≈øt needs be gone out of Britayne before the Nicen Councell, <note place="margin">Manu≈øcr. Antiq. de vit. S. Kebij. Capgrau. Catal. in eodem.</note> and Arrian Here≈øie, allthough he had continued with S. Hilary vnto his death, which no Writer affirmeth, but the contrary. And his lyuing Bishop in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne after his returne hither many yeares euidently ≈øo conuinceth. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe doth the bannishment of S. Hilary into Phrygia, many yeares before he dyed, by which argument we mu≈øt needs hold, that eyther S. Kebius of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne was bannished with him, or followed him in that exile, for which we haue neyther Authoritie, nor warrant of rea≈øon; or ≈øay, that S. Kebius was con≈øecrated Bishop by S. Hilary before his exilement by Con≈øtantius, and then returned into Britayne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And yet it is as vnprobable in my opinion, which the ≈øame Author ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to hold, that this Kebius then a Bishop was at that Councell of Arles in France, wherein S.

Re≈øtitutus ≈øub≈øcribed, was long before this time, and before S. Hilary him≈øelfe was eyther Bishop, Prei≈øt, or Clergie man, or of any fame in ≈øuch affayres.

Re≈øtitutus in the yeare 350. before eyther S<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Hilary was Bishop, or Pelagius vented his Here≈øie. Therefore I may choo≈øe the midle, as the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt way to walke in, for S. Kebius being made Bishop by S. Hilary, and his returne into Britayne to haue bene about the time of S. Hilary his Exile into Phrygria. For it is euident by S. Hilary him≈øelfe that it was long before he applyed him≈øelfe to the ≈øtudy of Diuinity, or probably was a Chri≈øtian; and by no Author was Bishop 20. yeares. And if we might write by coniecturs <note place="margin">Hilar. l. 1. de Trinitate. Baron. &amp; Spond. Annal. an. 355.</note> not wanting probabilitie, we should rather be of opinion, that this holy S. Kebius was one of our poore Brittish Bishops, ≈øpoken of before in generall termes, which were pre≈øent at the Councell of Ariminum, then of Arles, the la≈øt without all probabilitie, but for congruently thinking him to haue bene pre≈øent at Ariminum ≈øo generall an A≈ø≈øembly as is related, we haue the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance of time agreeing, that he was familiar with S. Hilary and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of France, that he was a Bishop of Britayne, and for his longe conuer≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in forreyne Countries more fitt then others for that employment now, and further he was a poore Bishop, ≈øuch as Britayne had but few at that time, and yet S.

                  <p n="2">2. The Here≈øie of Pelagius, and he the fir≈øt Author, and Name-giuer vnto it, haue giuen the greate≈øt ≈øtayne and blemish in that kinde to this Nation, and in this time. For as his Here≈øies were mo≈øt pe≈øtilent, dangerous, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious, ≈øo they tooke fir≈øt roote, and afterward fixed them≈øelues ≈øo deepely in this Britaine, that they were not rooted out, vntill after the comming of ≈øaint Augu≈øtine hither aboue 200. yeares after, notwith≈øtanding we had ≈øo many and worthie men heare both of our owne Nation, and others, diuers of them ≈øent hither by the Apo≈øtolike Roman See, Power, and Authoritie thereof, to oppo≈øe, and ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe it, as both our Scottish and English Writers, Catholiks and Prote≈øtants doe te≈øtifie. It is the common con≈øent of the Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians both of this and forreyne Countries, that this Pelagius was a Britan of this kingdome. Diuers of our Antiquaries not onely Catholiks but Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants hold, that he was a Monke, and Abbot after in our old renowned Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na≈øtery of Bangot. Which is made more probable, both in re≈øpect that Lepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Agricola his Scholler and follower in his errors a long time, though after recanting them, was a Prei≈øt and Monke of the ≈øame Mona≈øtery: <hi>Factus e≈øt Sacerdos &amp; Monachus in celebri Banchoren≈øi Caenobio.</hi> And of all places in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the parts thereabouts were mo≈øt infected with that Here≈øie, raigning there long after the time of ≈øaint Germanus and Lupus ≈øent hither by Pope Cele≈øtine to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe it, &amp; was in a Sinod of all the Bishops, Abbots, &amp; cheife Clergy men of Cambria there confuted and confounded by ≈øaint Dauid. And as I haue mentioned before, diuers Clergy men in that Country were longe after ≈øaint Dauids death, in the time of King Frequahard of Scotland ≈øtill infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted therewith. All Authors agree this Pelagius was very learned, and the Title Archereticke, Here≈øiarches, which is commonly giuen vnto him doth ≈øo te≈øtifie. So doth his di≈øper≈øing his Here≈øies into ≈øo many learned Nations, <hi>venena ≈øuae perfidiae longe lateque di≈øper≈øit.</hi> So doe the greate number of Councels a≈ø≈øembled in diuers places to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ne him.

So doe they which write of learned Writers, both auncient and later Catholiks and Prote≈øtants, witne≈ø≈øing that he wrote many and learned Catholike Bookes before he fell into Here≈øie. By which we may gather, that this Nation in ≈øuch troble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome and tempe≈øteous times had Schooles to breede vp learned men, by whome ≈øo ≈øoone as Pelagius was fallen into Here≈øie, and noted thereof
